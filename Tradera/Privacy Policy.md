#### Tradera user-ID

Your user-ID is displayed throughout Tradera (and, as a result, it is available to the public), and is connected to all of your Tradera activity. Other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, storefronts, feedback, ratings and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.

#### Personal data shared with other users

Tradera enables you to share personal and financial information to complete transactions and collect payments. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. We are not responsible for information that you choose to share with other users and partners and therefore we encourage you, where appropriate, to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. In order to further protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users’ contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. You must, under all circumstances, provide other users the option to request to be deleted from your database and a chance to review the information you have collected about them.

#### Transfer of Personal Data

We store and process your personal data on our servers located in Sweden and elsewhere in the world and are committed to providing appropriate protection for your personal data where such data is transferred outside of the EU/EEA. In the event that we share information with, for example, an IT provider located outside the EU/EEA, we take appropriate security measures such as the European Commission's standard contractual clauses. The European Commission's standard contractual clauses are available on their website.

We use physical, technical and organizational security measures to, in relation to the amount and sensitivity of personal data, prevent unauthorised processing, including but not limited to, unauthorised access to, acquisition and use of, loss, destruction, or damage to any users personal data.

#### Termination of account and data retention

Upon your request, and subject to the provisions in this section, we will close your account and, as soon as reasonably possible, erase your personal data so that it cannot be viewed by other users. Erasure of personal data will be based on your account status and in accordance with applicable law. At our own discretion we may also terminate or deactivate inactive accounts, or accounts that are used in violation with the terms of our [User agreement](https://info.tradera.com/en/anvandaravtal-eng/).

We never store personal data for a longer period than is necessary to comply with the purpose for which it was collected. For example, we store certain information for a longer period of time if required by applicable law, such as accounting- and tax regulations. In general, personal data from terminated or inactive accounts will be deleted or anonymised as soon as reasonably possibly after the account is terminated or deactivated. We may retain personal data from terminated or inactive accounts if:

* we need to be able to defend ourselves against legal claims or otherwise take legal action
* in the event of, for example, a dispute; or
* if we are obliged to retain the personal data to meet legal obligations such as compliance with member state legislation, particularly fraud and money laundering prevention, tax legislation or to otherwise take actions permitted by law.

Provided the above circumstances, personal data will be kept securely and only for as long as necessary.

#### Your Rights

Subject to limitations set out in privacy regulations applicable in the EU/EEA, you have certain rights in respect of your personal data. Exercising your rights is not accompanied by any costs or fees. We strive to adhere to your rights as soon as possible after you contact us with a request.

**Right to information**

You have the right to know what information we process about you. The easiest way to find out is to read this Privacy statement.

**Right to access**

You have the right to request an extract from our register. This is a summary of the personal data we process about you. If you contact us with such a request, we will ask you to identify yourself.

You do not have the right to request access to personal data that does not refer to you.

**Right to rectification and completion**

If your information changes, for example by changing your name or address, you can rectify these by visiting your [My Tradera-page](https://www.tradera.com/my/settings) or by contacting us so that we can rectify or complete the information we have about you.

**Right to object**

You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data. If you wish to do so, please contact us at privacy@tradera.com.

You have the right to object and oppose the processing of your personal data for direct marketing measures. If you object to such processing, we will no longer process your personal data for that purpose and will therefore not be able to offer you all of our services, such as access to certain information.

You may also object to processing carried out by us on the basis of our legitimate interest. In the event of such a request, we will assess whether we have a compelling legitimate interest that nevertheless justifies the continued processing of your personal data and which overrides your interest of non-processing, or whether we need to continue processing the personal data in order to determine, exercise or defend ourselves against legal claims. In the absence of such legitimate interest, we will cease with the objected processing.

**Right to transfer and data portability**

Upon request for a transfer of your personal data, we will transfer the data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. In some cases, you may also have the right to obtain and transfer your personal data to another controller (data portability). Your right to request transfer or data portability of your personal data is limited to such information that you yourself have provided to us. Our right to process your personal data does not cease after such a transfer.

**Consent**

If you provided your consent to us for certain processing, you may withdraw it at any time, you can read more about this above in the section where we explain which processing we carry out on the basis of your consent. A withdrawn consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing we carried out while we had your consent. We may not however, continue to process your personal data on the basis of your consent from the moment you withdraw it.

However, if you withdraw your consent, we will continue to process personal data that is based on another legal ground, such as legal obligation, legitimate interest and fulfilment of contract.

**Complaints and comments**

If you believe that we have not processed your personal data correctly, please contact us with your comments at privacy@tradera.com.

You may also, if you are not satisfied with the way we address your concerns, lodge a complaint with the applicable supervisory authority which in Sweden is Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten. You can find their contact details at www.imy.se.
