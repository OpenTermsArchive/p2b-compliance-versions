**Introduction**

**This agreement, Tradera’s User Agreement, Tradera’s Privacy Policy and all other policies posted on our site set out the terms on which Tradera offers you access to and use of Tradera’s sites, marketplace services, applications and tools (collectively ”Services”). You can find our policies** [**here**](http://info.tradera.com/faq/regler-pa-tradera/)**. All policies, including Tradera’s Privacy Policy, are incorporated in this User Agreement. You agree to comply with all terms of this User Agreement when accessing or using our Services. The entity you are contracting with is Tradera Marketplace AB (reg. no. 556569-4642), Sankt Eriksgatan 117, 113 43 Stockholm (”Tradera”, ”we” or ”us”).**

Before you pay for a purchased item or receive a payout for a sold item, you must also accept Tradera’s terms and conditions for payments. Depending on whether you are residing in Sweden or abroad, different terms and conditions for payments will be applicable. For natural persons residing in Sweden, (i) Terms and Conditions - payments (customers residing in Sweden) apply, and for customers residing abroad and legal persons, (ii) Terms and Conditions - payments (companies and customers residing abroad) apply. Tradera’s own payment service is only regulated in the Terms and Conditions - payments (customers residing in Sweden). 

This User Agreement is effective from 8 May 2023. [**The previous version**](https://info.tradera.com/en/anvandaravtal-eng-2022-2023/) of this User Agreement apply for the period between 16 November 2022 and 7 May 2023.

**Scope**

Tradera is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy just about anything in a variety of pricing formats and locations. Tradera is not a traditional auctioneer.

Tradera does not own any of the items offered or sold through Tradera. The actual contract for sale is directly between the seller and the buyer.

We can provide guidance regarding prices, pricing, listing and other such questions as part of our Services. Such guidance is provided solely for informational purposes and you may decide not to follow it. Tradera does not review users’ listings or content. While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes between users, Tradera has no control over and does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of user’s content, listings or feedback; the ability of sellers to sell items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.

**Using Tradera**

In connection with using or accessing the Services, you will not:

* post, list or upload content or items in inappropriate categories or areas on our sites;
* breach or circumvent any laws, third-party rights or our policies;
* sell items infringing any intellectual property rights that belong to third parties or in any other way infringe any copyright, trademark or intellectual property right that belongs to a third party;
* use our Services if you are not able to form legally binding contracts, or are temporarily or indefinitely suspended from using our Services;
* fail to pay for items purchased by you, unless the seller has materially changed the item’s description after you bid, a clear typographical error is made, or you cannot contact the seller (see our [**Rules for Buyers**](https://info.tradera.com/en/bids-are-binding/));
* fail to deliver items sold by you, unless the buyer fails to comply with the posted terms in your listing or you cannot contact the buyer:
* manipulate the price of any item or interfere with any other user’s listings;
* post or use false, inaccurate, misleading or defamatory content or information;
* take any actions that may undermine the feedback or ratings system (see our [**Feedback policies**](https://info.tradera.com/en/review-policy/));
* transfer your Tradera account (including Feedback) and user ID to another party without our consent;
* allow, directly or indirectly, another party to use your user ID or password;
* distribute or post spam, unsolicited or bulk electronic communications, chain letters or pyramid schemes;
* distribute or post viruses or any other technologies that may harm Tradera or the interests or property of Tradera’s users
* use automated means, such as scrapers, robots or spiders to access our Services for any purpose. You will also not circumvent our automated means, prevent or interfere with the working of our Services, or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
* export or re-export any Tradera application or tool, except in compliance with the export control laws of any relevant jurisdictions and in accordance with rules and restrictions posted on the site;
* copy, change or make available (a) rights or content related to our Services or (b) Tradera’s work, photographs, pictures, trademarks, texts or other content;
* copy, reproduce, change, process, translate, transfer, make available or present any content (except your own content) from Tradera, Tradera’s Services or any third party, without obtaining prior written consent from Tradera or, if applicable, any concerned third party;
* commercialize or sublicense any Tradera application or any information or software associated with such application; or
* collect information about users, such as e-mail addresses, without their consent.

If you register with Tradera as a business user, you accept that you have the authority to represent and commit the business to this User Agreement. If you carry out business on Tradera, you must comply with the laws that apply to trading on the site that you use.

We will start providing our Services to you as soon as you have accepted this User Agreement. If you and Tradera do not agree otherwise, you agree that you do not have the right to cancel this User Agreement according to the Distance and Off-Premises Contracts Act (2005:59) after we have started to provide the Services.

We reserve the right to close accounts that cannot be confirmed or that have not been used for 12 months, and to change or cease to provide Tradera’s Services in whole or in part. If Tradera substantially changes or ceases to provide the Services, Tradera intends to notify you in advance in accordance with the ”Miscellaneous” section below.

You have the right to terminate your user account with Tradera at any time, by notifying us via our Customer Service. Before closing the account, you must have completed all of your ongoing sales, bids and purchases and we must also have received payment for all outstanding fees. You will subsequently have no right to bid for, purchase or list new items for sale.

**Abusing Tradera**

_General_

We may limit, suspend or terminate our Services and user accounts, and limit or prohibit your access to and use of our Services, stop bidding processes and remove listings, delay or remove content on the site, remove certain status updates that belong to an account, reduce or eliminate discounts and take technical and legal steps to prevent you from using our Services, if:

* we believe that you are causing problems or risks of liability in damages;
* we believe that such limitations will increase the safety and security for Tradera’s users or reduce the risk that we or Tradera’s users will incur a payment obligation;
* we believe that you are infringing the rights of a third party;
* we believe that you are acting contrary to the purpose of this User Agreement or our policies or are insulting our employees or users;
* despite our reasonable efforts, we are unable to confirm information that you provide to us; or
* you fail to pay the fees for our Services when they fall due for payment.

This provision shall not limit other remedies to which Tradera is entitled.

When a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider previous events and the particular circumstances of the case in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers.

_If you are a seller_

In addition to our entitlement to terminate or limit the Services as set out above under "General", and without any obligation to make any refunds, we are entitled to terminate the Services (either in whole or in part) and withhold you from selling further goods on Tradera if you (i) can be deemed to be insolvent for any reason; (ii) are in breach of the terms of this User Agreement, including Tradera's Terms and Conditions - payments (customers residing in Sweden) or Terms and Conditions - payments (companies and customers residing abroad), depending on which terms and conditions for payments that apply, or if Tradera has reason to believe that you will breach such terms; (iii) provide Tradera with inaccurate or misleading information or conceal relevant facts; or (iv) offer goods or services that are contrary to Tradera's country-specific ethical guidelines in force from time to time, or otherwise act in a manner which, either directly or indirectly, can reasonably be deemed to be contrary to rules adopted by credit/debit card companies or their industry organization or any other applicable payment service terms that are relevant to Tradera (Tradera's ethical guidelines can be provided upon request). Tradera may obtain access information from you as a seller in order to determine whether you are in breach of this User Agreement, including Tradera's Terms and Conditions - payments (customers residing in Sweden) or Terms and Conditions - payments (companies and customers residing abroad), depending on which terms and conditions for payments that apply.

_Suspending or restricting a business user's use of the Services_

A decision on suspending or restricting a business user's use of the Services, in whole or in part, will be communicated to the concerned business user at the latest when the decision takes effect with a statement of the reasons for the decision.

A decision on terminating a business user's use of the Services, in whole or in part, will be provided to the concerned business user at the latest 30 days prior to the effective date of the termination with a statement of the reasons for the decision. However, the notice period of 30 days shall not apply if:

* the termination is caused by a legal or regulatory obligation which requires Tradera to terminate the provision of the whole of its Services to a given business user in a manner which does not allow Tradera to respect that notice period;
* Tradera exercises a right of termination under an imperative reason pursuant to national law which is in compliance with EU law; or
* Tradera can demonstrate that the business user concerned has repeatedly infringed the applicable terms and conditions, resulting in the termination of the provision of the whole of the Services in question.

In case the notice period does not apply, Tradera will provide the business user concerned, without undue delay, with a statement of reasons for that decision.

Tradera shall not be under an obligation to provide reasons for the decision to suspend, restrict or terminate a business user's use of the Services, where Tradera is subject to a legal or regulatory obligation not to provide the specific facts or circumstances or the reference to the applicable ground or grounds, or where Tradera can demonstrate that the business user has repeatedly infringed the applicable terms and conditions of this User Agreement, Terms and Conditions - payments (customers residing in Sweden) or Terms and Conditions - payments (companies and customers residing abroad), depending on which terms and conditions for payments that apply, resulting in termination of the provision of the whole of the Services in question.

* your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category until after up to 24 hours. Tradera cannot guarantee exact listing durations;

* Limitations regarding the types of Services you may use and their functionality may apply based on your use of the Services.

**Purchase Conditions**

When buying an item you agree to comply with our Rules for Buyers, and that:

* you are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or commitment to buy;
* you enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item or if you have the winning bid (or if your offer for an item is accepted in another way);

**International Buying and Selling**

It is lawful to sell certain products to other countries. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.

Tradera may provide a function, through services or automatic tools provided by third parties, which enable listings and other content on Tradera to be translated, in whole or in part, into other languages. Users then have the option to use such services or tools. Tradera cannot guarantee the availability or the accuracy of any translation. Users use all such services at their own risk.

**Content**

Tradera will have the right, but not the obligation, to use for commercial purposes all content that you provide to us or make available to us by using the Services, for example when listing or offering, buying and/or selling items or services. In this User Agreement, ”content” means all information (including, but not limited to, photographs, images, texts, words, videos, data, concepts, ideas, technology, databases and trademarks).

You hereby grant Tradera an unlimited, non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, fully transferable and fully sublicensable right to use, copy, reproduce, alter, process, translate, transfer, make available and/or communicate such content for the purposes and in any media, channel, technology or region decided by Tradera from time to time. The sublicense according to this provision shall, to the extent permitted by law, also include your moral rights to the content.

You warrant that all content that you provide or make available to us by your use of the Services is accurate and non-confidential. You also warrant that the content is not infringing any intellectual property right of any third party.

If you are a business user, we allow shoppers to rate products that you list on Tradera and we may make these ratings publicly available.

The processing and transfer of personal data is further governed by the Privacy Policy.

**Limitation of Liability**

We try to keep access to Tradera and the Services safe, secure, and functioning properly, but we cannot guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our Services. Bid updates and other notification functionality in Tradera’s Services may not occur in real time. Such functionality is subject to delays beyond Tradera’s control.

We (and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, representatives, officers, agents and employees) will in no event be liable to you for any indirect losses, including loss occurring in the business, loss of data, loss of profits, loss of business opportunity, loss of reputation, or disruption to the business, or any other losses that we could not reasonably foresee, resulting directly or indirectly from:

* your use of or your inability to use the Services;
* pricing, shipping, or other guidance provided by Tradera;
* delays or disruptions in our Services;
* viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing or linking to our Services;
* the content, actions, or inactions of third parties, including losses caused by items that are listed via our Services;
* the destruction of items allegedly infringing third-party intellectual property rights;
* a suspension or other action taken with respect to your account or breach of the ”Abusing Tradera” section above;
* the duration or manner in which your listings appear in search results as set out in the ”Listing Conditions” section above; or
* your need to modify practices, content, or behavior, or your loss of or inability to do business, as a result of changes to this User Agreement or our policies.

You agree that you are solely responsible for ensuring that the actions you take comply with the laws and rules and regulations that apply to you and that the items you list, sell or buy on our site are in compliance with law.

Even if we use technical solutions to try to verify that the information our users provide is accurate, verification on the Internet is difficult. Tradera cannot guarantee and is not responsible for ensuring that the identity our users have stated or the information our users provide on our site is accurate.

Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) the price of the item sold on Tradera, including the original shipping costs, or (b) the amount of fees which you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, or (c) SEK 1,000.

The provisions of this User Agreement shall not limit Tradera’s liability for willful default or gross negligence or Tradera’s statutory liability.

**Indemnity**

You will indemnify and hold us harmless (and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, representatives, officers, agents and employees) for and from all losses and costs, including reasonable legal fees, we incur due to or arising out of your breach of this User Agreement, your improper use of the site, services, applications and tools, or your breach of any applicable law or infringement of any rights of a third party.

**Additional terms and conditions for the add-on service ”Butik”**

If you are using ”[**Butik**](https://info.tradera.com/en/foretag/#butik)”, our add-on service for business users, we place great emphasis on ensuring that, _inter alia_, products, product descriptions and delivery terms for your Butik maintain a high standard. Therefore, in addition to the rules for sellers in force from time to time, Tradera may impose additional requirements on individual Butiks concerning e.g:

* delivery time;
* types of products offered for sale; and
* quality of images and product description.

If additional terms and conditions are relevant to your Butik, you will be requested to make corrections. If, following such request, you have not made the necessary corrections within the time limit set out under section "_Changes to agreements if you are a business user" below_, Tradera is entitled to immediately limit or prohibit access to and use of the add-on service according to the terms set out in section "_Suspending and restricting a business user's use of the Services_" above. Tradera may then also remove listings or other content that belong to your Butik and take other steps to prevent you from using your Butik. Additional terms and conditions for the add-on service Butik, such as applicable price lists, are available on the [**Butik**](https://info.tradera.com/en/foretag/#butik) pages on our website. The add-on service Butik is terminable by either you or us on 30 days’ notice.

**If you are a consumer**

Consumers have specific rights under mandatory consumer legislation and rules and regulations. If you are a consumer, Tradera does not intend to limit or amend these rights by this User Agreement. We also do not intend to impose on you any obligations that are greater than those imposed on you under mandatory consumer legislation and rules and regulations. This applies, among other things, to the Limitation of Liability and Indemnity provisions in this User Agreement.

**Determination of business user's ranking in the Services**

Tradera uses different parameters to determine a business user's ranking in the Services, as set out in the policy for "[**Bäst Träff**](https://info.tradera.com/?path=%2Fguide%2Fhur-fungerar-sorteringen-basta-traff)", available on our website.

**Legal Disputes**

If a dispute arises between you and Tradera regarding the Services, we recommend that, in the first instance, you contact us directly via our [**Customer Service**](https://info.tradera.com/en/kontakt/) to try to find a solution. If you are unable to resolve a dispute with Customer Service, you may ask for the case to be escalated to Tradera's internal complaint-handling system. A second line function will then be responsible to provide guidance. If the dispute is not resolved by the second line support, a third line support function will be involved to finally resolve the dispute. Handling of complaints will be processed swiftly and effectively, and the outcome will be communicated to you individually.

We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute by way of alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation or arbitration.

Tradera is willing to engage the lawyers Anders Arthur or Fredrik Norburg to attempt to reach an agreement with business users on the settlement of any disputes between Tradera and the business user arising in relation to the provision of the Services, including complaints that could not be resolved by means of Tradera's internal complaint-handling system. 

Swedish law shall apply to all claims, disputes or other issues arising from this User Agreement. Disputes shall be resolved by a Swedish court of general jurisdiction and, for customers who are not consumers, with the Stockholm District Court as the court of first instance.
