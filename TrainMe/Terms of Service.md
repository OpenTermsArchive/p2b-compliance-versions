The registration of a Customer via the creation of a Personal Account is the prerequisite for any reservation and payment of a Service (cf. General Conditions of Use of the Site).

When a Customer wishes to benefit from a Service with a Coach, the Customer must first read the conditions and details of the Services offered by the Coach on his presentation sheet, before making his reservation (for example the areas geographical areas served by the Coach, the maximum number of people who can attend the coach's session, etc.) A commitment is only formed between the Client and the Coach from the moment the Client has paid online for the chosen Service . The User acknowledges that payment for the Service does not constitute acceptance of a firm offer and that the conclusion of the Service is subject to confirmation by the Coach, even if the latter is obliged to accept the reservation except in cases of force majeure or in the event of presumption by the Coach of the existence of a risk as to his safety following the first telephone contact. If the Coach is unable to honor this reservation, (for example in the event of a serious event), the Company and the Coach will use their best efforts to offer an alternative time slot or an alternative Coach to the Customer as soon as possible or refund.

Payment for the Service is made by bank card, by secure payment (via Stripe) made available to Users on the Site.

The consignment of the price of the Service is made in a dedicated account opened in the name of the Company with a banking establishment of its choice. Once the price of the Service has been entered into the dedicated account, the Company alone is authorized to order the banking establishment to pay it to the Coach, after deducting the commission due to the Company for the use of its services.

Under no circumstances may a Service be performed in the absence of payment of the price of the Service.

The Customer has a period of fourteen (14) calendar days to exercise his right of withdrawal without having to justify reasons or pay penalties. This period of fourteen (14) days runs from the date of validation of its online payment. The Customer may exercise his right of withdrawal by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Company's Customer Service. In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 121-20-2 of the Consumer Code, the right of withdrawal cannot be exercised when the Customer has already benefited from his Service. In the event of cancellation of the Service for valid reason at the request of the User (for example: in accordance with his right of withdrawal of 14 days from the date of the online reservation, or in the event of force majeure) and / or the Coach (e.g. in the event of force majeure or in the event of presumption by the Coach of the existence of a risk as to his safety following the first telephone contact), the sums initially due for the Service will be returned to the Client, and the Coach may not under any circumstances claim payment of said sums, insofar as he alone assumes the risks associated with the Service. For the sake of clarification, in the event of cancellation by the Coach for reasons of safety risks following the Coach's visit to the Client, the sums due for the Service will not be returned to the Client. After the withdrawal period of 14 days, the sums due for the Service will be returned to the Customer up to 100% if the Customer cancels the Service more than 24 hours before the scheduled date of the Service, and up to 0% if the Customer cancels the Service less than 24 hours before the scheduled date of the Service.

The evaluations left by the Clients cannot be modified or deleted from the Coach's profile, unless the Coach makes an exceptional request to the Company explaining the situation and after informing the Client.
