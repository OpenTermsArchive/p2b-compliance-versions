Please note that these terms of use do not apply to any cleaning or other services that you provide to Users (as defined below).

Other applicable terms

These terms of use refer to our [privacy and cookie policy](https://www.helpling.co.uk/privacy), which sets out the terms on which we process any personal data we collect from you or that you provide to us, as well as information about the cookies and/or other similar technologies (for example, analytics) we use.

Information about us and how to contact us

Helpling is a technology platform, accessed through the Site or the App, that connects users **(Users)** with third party providers of cleaning services and certain other services as listed on the Site such as you **(Service Providers)**. It enables Users to engage the services of a Service Provider in their area for the provision of those services **(Services)**.

  

Helpling is operated and owned by Teddle Limited (**we** or **us**). We are a limited company registered in England and Wales under company number 07991751 and have our registered office at Teddle Limited, 86-90 Paul Street, London, EC2A 4NE. Our VAT number is GB 132 8488 02.

  

If you wish to contact us in writing, have a complaint or are required to give us notice in writing, you can send this to us by email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.helpling.co.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or by pre-paid post to our main trading address referred to above. If we have to contact you or give you notice in writing, we will do so by email to any email address you provide to us.

Registration by the Service Provider

You acknowledge that, in determining whether to include you on the Site as a potential supplier of Services, we rely on the accuracy and completeness of the information supplied by you during the registration process. You therefore confirm that all such information is accurate and not misleading and that we may use it to carry out any of the searches or checks referred to below.

  

You also confirm that you possess all approvals and authority (including the necessary immigration status) required to work in the United Kingdom on a self-employed basis and, in particular, to provide Services to Users.

  

You authorise us and/or any of our appointed agents to carry out all necessary searches, including searches of consumer credit records, in order to verify the information you have provided.

  

You also authorise us and/or our appointed agents to perform Basic Disclosure and other checks through Disclosure Scotland [(http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk)](https://www.helpling.co.uk/(http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk)), together with any other relevant criminal record searches we consider appropriate. You hereby grant permission for Disclosure Scotland (or any other criminal record search provider) to forward the Disclosure Certificate (or similar search result) direct to us and for us to open the Disclosure Certificate (or similar search result) upon receipt (even if it is addressed to you).

  

You must promptly disclose to us all matters which are material to your ability and suitability to provide Services to Users, as well as any material changes thereto.

Relationship between the parties

If we decide in our absolute discretion to include you on the Site as a potential supplier of Services, your inclusion on the Site will be subject to these terms of use. In such case, you authorise us to act as booking agent for you whereby we will process bookings and contractually commit you to supply Services to Users on the basis of these terms of use.

  

You will act as an independent contractor and will not be our employee. You shall be fully responsible for any tax and national insurance and social security contributions and any other liability, deduction, contribution, assessment or claim arising from, or made in connection with, these terms of use or your provision of the Services. You shall indemnify us against all reasonable costs and expenses and any tax, penalty, fine or interest incurred or payable by us in connection with, or in consequence of, any such liability, deduction, contribution, assessment or claim, other than where such liability, deduction, contribution, assessment or claim arises out of our negligence or wilful default. We may at our option satisfy such indemnity (whether in whole or in part) by way of deduction from any amounts due to you from us under these terms of use.

Changes to these terms of use

We may revise these terms of use at any time and you should check these terms of use from time to time to take notice of any changes we have made, as they are legally binding on you. We may also notify you of any changes by email. If you do not agree to any such changes, please stop using Helpling and (if applicable) delete the App from your Mobile Device.

  

These terms of use were last updated on June 15 2020.

Services

If you accept a contract with a particular User, whether on a one-off or other basis, you agree to supply Services to that User in accordance with these terms of use. You acknowledge that, notwithstanding your obligations to us herein regarding the standard of such Services, you will contract direct with each User for the supply of Services and, in the event of a dispute with the User, your recourse is against the User and not us.

  

If you cause any damage to a User’s property in the course of providing the Services to them, you will be fully responsible for such damage and will reimburse the User accordingly. We therefore recommend that, for so long as you are providing Services to Users, you take out and maintain in force with a reputable insurer appropriate general liability insurance cover in respect of any such damage.

  

You promise that you have the necessary skills to supply the Services.

  

You shall supply the Services in accordance with a high degree of professionalism and the highest industry standards.

  

You shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the provision of the Services and otherwise in connection with these terms of use.

  

You shall agree with the relevant User as to the provision and procurement of materials required by you to provide the Services to that User. We are not responsible for the provision of any tools, equipment or materials.

  

You acknowledge that we will notify you of any User cancellation by email and it is your responsibility to monitor your emails frequently.

  

If you have to cancel a scheduled booking or are otherwise unable or unavailable to attend the agreed location to provide the Services requested, you must notify us and the relevant User by email or telephone as soon as possible and without undue delay.

  

If you fail to attend the agreed location at the scheduled time of the visit, we reserve the right to charge you a non-attendance administration fee (as notified to you from time to time) to cover our reasonable costs arising as a result of the missed booking which we may, at our election, deduct from any amounts due to you from us.

  

You shall promptly notify us:

*   if, for any reason, you cannot attend any scheduled visit (in which case you must promptly notify the User also) or otherwise become unable or unavailable to supply the Services as contracted;
*   if you receive any complaints from Users; and
*   of any grievance that you may have in relation to Users.

  

You shall attempt to resolve any complaint by a User directly with said User.

  

You shall provide reasonable co-operation to us in connection with these terms of use and comply with our reasonable requirements, including prompt provision of such information and documents as we may reasonably request in connection with these terms of use.

  

You shall only use User contact information insofar as is reasonably necessary to provide the Services. You shall keep such information confidential and shall delete it if requested to do so by us.

  

We do not guarantee that you will receive any, or any particular level of, contracts or revenues from the arrangements contemplated by these terms of use.

  

We do not carry out any checks on Users and cannot provide any guarantees as to the conduct of Users or the suitability or safety of their premises. You attend cleaning visits at your own risk. You must leave immediately if you have any concerns as to such matters.

  

By registering to use Helpling, you agree that all bookings between you and Users will be made through Helpling and that you will not supply any Services to any Users who have previously booked you through Helpling, or whose contact details you have received from us, other than through Helpling. If a User offers to engage or employ you to provide Services other than through Helpling, you must refuse such offer and notify us immediately. If you accept any such offer or if you make a similar offer to a User, we will immediately withdraw your right to use Helpling and you will be required to compensate us in respect of any losses we suffer as a result up to a maximum of £500.

  

You also agree not to supply any Services to any Users who have previously booked you through Helpling, or whose contact details you have received from us, for a period of six months after the date of termination of the legal agreement between us.

Fees and payment

You are free to set the amount you charge for the Services you provide to Users. Receipts for any payments received from Users will be issued automatically by Helpling on your behalf and will include your name and details.

  

Payment processing services for Service Providers on Helpling are provided by Stripe and are subject to the [Stripe Connected Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/gb/connect-account/legal), which includes the [Stripe Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/gb/legal) (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as a Service Provider on Helpling, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Helpling enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Helpling accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Helpling to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.

The payout of the amounts paid by the User to the payment service provider (Stripe) are processed on the 1st and the 15th of the month (or the following business day should these dates fall on a non business day). The amounts which are then available for payment at the payment service provider shall be paid to the Service Provider by the payment service provider.

We shall pay interest on overdue sums at 2% per annum over the base rate for the time being of Barclays Bank Plc (or its successor).

Any provisions in these terms of use excluding or limiting liability will apply regardless of the form of action, whether under statute, in contract or tort (including negligence) or otherwise. Nothing in these terms of use is in any way intended to exclude or restrict either party’s liability for negligence causing death or personal injury or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or for any liability which may not legally be excluded or limited.

  

We shall not be liable for breach of these terms of use unless you have given us prompt written notice of the breach and a reasonable opportunity thereafter to rectify the breach at our expense.

  

Our total liability under, or in connection with, these terms of use in respect of any act or omission, or any series of connected acts or omissions, shall be limited to the amount paid to you in the six months preceding the relevant act or omission.

  

In no circumstances shall we be liable for any consequential, indirect or special loss or damages or for economic losses (including, without limitation, loss of revenue, profits, contracts, business or anticipated savings) or for damage to, or loss of, data or for damage to, or loss of, reputation or goodwill.

Links to third party websites and resources

The Site and/or the App may contain links to other websites and resources provided by third parties, including, without limitation, advertisers.

You will need to make your own independent judgement regarding your interaction with any such websites or resources, including the purchase and use of any products or services accessible through them. We are not responsible for, and do not endorse, their content or their privacy policies (if any) and we will not be liable for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them.

Events outside our control

We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or any delay in the performance of, any of our obligations under these terms of use that is caused by any event or circumstance beyond our reasonable control, including any failure of public or private telecommunications networks or any delays or latency due to your physical location or your wireless data service provider’s network.

You agree not to disclose, divulge or communicate directly or indirectly to any third party any information regarding us, Helpling.co.uk or any Users (including their contact details) without our (or their, as applicable) prior written consent. You must not use any such information other than is necessary to provide the services requested by Users.

We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms of use to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these terms of use.

You may not transfer your rights or obligations under these terms of use to another person. However, at the approval of the User, you may sub-contract your obligations and work exclusively to other Helpling Service Providers. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these terms of use, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

Each of the conditions of these terms of use operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.

These terms of use are not intended to confer rights on anyone other than you and us.

Applicable law

These terms of use, their subject matter and formation are governed by English law.

The Courts of England and Wales will, subject to the paragraph below, have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim arising from, or related to, these terms of use.

Nothing in the foregoing paragraph will limit our right to take proceedings against you in any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor will the taking of proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude us from taking proceedings in any other jurisdiction, whether concurrently or not, to the extent permitted by the law of such other jurisdiction.
