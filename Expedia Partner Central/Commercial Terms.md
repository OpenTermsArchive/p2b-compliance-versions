Agreement (ETP)



Expedia Collect Agreement (EC) Property Collect Agreement (PC)

General Terms and Conditions



A. EXPEDIA COLLECT AND HOTEL COLLECT BOOKINGS



1. Compensation. For each room night covered by a Standalone Booking, Expedia will be entitled to compensation equal to the

Compensation Percentage of the Room Price (the “Compensation”). You may increase the Compensation at your discretion.



2. Agreement Types. If your agreement type is “Expedia Traveler Preference” then Expedia may make your rooms available in its

discretion as Hotel Collect Bookings or Expedia Collect Bookings. If your agreement type is “Hotel Collect Only,” Expedia wil l not make your

rooms available as Expedia Collect Bookings. If your agreement type is “Expedia Collect Only,” then Expedia will not make your rooms available

as Hotel Collect Bookings.



3. Expedia Collect Bookings. For each Expedia Collect Booking, Expedia will act as a facilitator of the booking on your behalf but acting in

its own name and will collect advance payment of relevant amounts from guests. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, you are responsible for

collecting Hotel Fees directly from guests. For each Expedia Collect Booking, you will be entitled to an amount equal to the Room Price minus the

Compensation (the “EC Remittance”). For each Expedia Collect Booking, Expedia will pay to you the EC Remittance and Taxes paid by the guest

(except to the extent Expedia is required to pay the Taxes directly to the Tax authorities) as set forth in Section A.4.



4. Payments for Expedia Collect Bookings. Amounts due to you for Expedia Collect Bookings will be paid through an Expedia-approved

payment process made available to you through Expedia Partner Central or other means. You may elect to use a single-use credit card system to

collect amounts due for Expedia Collect Bookings if Expedia makes that option available to you. If you do, Expedia will provide you with a single-

use credit card for each relevant Expedia Collect Booking. You will charge such credit card for the EC Remittance and Taxes (except to the extent

Expedia is required to pay the Taxes directly to the Tax authorities) promptly following the guest’s checkout or, subject to Section D.2, after the

guest's cancellation or no-show, or as otherwise permitted by Expedia in writing.

If Expedia makes available to you, and you elect to use, an electronic invoicing process, then for each Expedia Collect Booki ng, you will provide

Expedia an electronic invoice within 12 months after the date of check-out, cancellation or no-show. You must submit all invoices electronically

via Expedia’s then-current invoicing system, or as otherwise directed by Expedia. Each invoice will specify, for each booking, th e guest’s name,

the Expedia booking ID, the applicable Rate(s), Hotel Fees and Taxes. Expedia will pay all undisputed amounts within 30 days of receipt of an

invoice submitted electronically. If you do not charge the relevant single-use credit card or invoice Expedia in accordance with this Section for all

amounts for an Expedia Collect Booking within 12 months of the date after check-out, cancellation or no-show, then neither Expedia nor the

guest will have any further obligation related to such booking. You will apply each payment received to the specific invoice being paid, and you

will not apply any payment received to any other invoiced amount or amount otherwise due. Expedia may make changes or updates to i ts

payment system, payment methods, and invoicing system or requirements at any time.



5. Hotel Collect Bookings. For each Hotel Collect Booking, Expedia will act as a facilitator of the booking acting on your behalf and in your

name, but you are responsible for collecting all relevant amounts directly from guests at the time of check-out unless you and Expedia agree on a

different time of collection. For each Hotel Collect Booking, you will pay Expedia the Compensation as set forth in Section A.6.



6. Payments for Hotel Collect Bookings. Expedia will submit invoices for Hotel Collect Bookings to you through Expedia’s then-current

invoicing system. You agree to pay all invoices for Hotel Collect Bookings upon receipt of invoice using one of the payment options avai lable to

you in Expedia Partner Central or otherwise notified to you by Expedia. You agree not to use a third-party payment processor to process

payments for Hotel Collect Bookings for you without Expedia’s consent and Expedia may charge a fee related to any use of a th ird-party payment

processor by you. You agree that if Expedia incurs bank fees or other similar charges due to your payment method, you will reimburse Expedia

for those fees or charges. If you do not pay Expedia within 15 days of the date of the invoice, you may be subject to late ch arges equal to the

lower of 2%, or the maximum amount permitted by law of the outstanding balance for each month or portion thereof that the payment is

overdue.



B. FENCED BOOKINGS



1. Package and Opaque Bookings. You agree that for each Rate Plan for Expedia Collect and Hotel Collect

Bookings you provide, you will create, or Expedia will create for you, a Rate Plan that may be used for Package Bookings and/or Opaque Bookings.

Except as set forth in this Section, Expedia may offer any rooms as made available by you under this Agreement for reservation as a Package

Booking or an Opaque Booking. For each room night covered by a Package Booking or Opaque Booking, you will be entitled to an amount equal

to (a) the EC Remittance for the corresponding Expedia Collect Booking Rate Plan reduced by the Fenced Booking Percentage (the “Package

Remittance”) and (b) Taxes paid by the guest (unless Expedia is required to pay the Taxes directly to the Tax authorities). You may increase t he

Fenced Booking Percentage at your discretion. You may also opt-out or place availability restrictions on Rate Plans for Package Bookings through

Expedia Partner Central, so long as you communicate these restrictions to Expedia in advance. You may discontinue participati on in Opaque

Bookings by providing 10 days written notice to Expedia.



2. Standalone Fenced Bookings. You agree that for each Rate Plan for Expedia Collect and Hotel Collect

Bookings you provide, you will create or Expedia will create for you, a Rate Plan with a Rate that is reduced by the Fenced Booking Percentage

that may be used by Expedia for Standalone Fenced Bookings or to match rates for your rooms that are published through your own or any third-

party distribution channels. For each room night covered by a Standalone Fenced Booking, you will be entitled to an amount eq ual to the Room

Price for the

Standalone Fenced Booking reduced by the Compensation, plus Taxes paid by the guest (unless Expedia is required to pay the Taxes directly to

the Tax authorities). Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, you may discontinue participation in Standalone Fenced Bookings or rate matching

under this Section by opting out as provided in Expedia Partner Central.



3. Payments for Fenced Bookings. Where Expedia collects guest payment for a Fenced Booking, you will collect amounts due from Expedia in

the same way that you collect amounts for Expedia Collect Bookings. Where you are responsible for collecting guest payment for a Fenced

Booking, you will pay Expedia in the same way that you pay Expedia for Hotel Collect Bookings .



C. ROOMS, RATES AND AVAILABILITY



1. Rates. You agree that the Rates and Rate Plans you provide to Expedia will be equal to or better than those made available through your

own Online Public booking or distribution channels. You will not make any rules, restrictions, policies, and/or conditions (i ncluding cancellation

rules) applicable to any room that you make available

through the Expedia System more restrictive than those applicable to any comparable room that you make available through your own Online

Public booking or distribution channels. Subject to Sections E.2 and E.5, and unless otherwise agreed, you instruct Expedia not to display (i)

Expedia Collect or Hotel Collect Bookings with a Room Price lower than the relevant Best Available Rate, (ii) Standalone Fenc ed Bookings with a

Room Price lower than the relevant Best Available Rate reduced by the Fenced Booking Percentage, or (iii) Package Bookings or Opaque Bookings

with a Room Price lower than the Package Remittance. Subject to this Section, you agree that Expedia will determine the total price of any

Booking at its sole discretion. Providing us with competitive rates, rules, restrictions, policies and conditions is part of a fair and balanced

commercial bargain between you and Expedia, one which delivers incremental bookings to you on attractive terms (including importantly at no

upfront costs), and one which allows us to provide a comprehensive search and booking service to guests, while protecting Expedia from free-

riding on our considerable investments in attracting guests to your rooms.



2. Booking Notifications. Expedia will provide notice of each Booking processed through the Expedia System. You will provide Expedia

confirmation of receipt of every Booking notification within 48 hours of Expedia’s notification being delivered to you. You m ust honor every

Booking for which you receive a Booking notification.



D. GUEST EXPERIENCE



1. Guest Experience. You will not treat any guest that books a room through the Expedia System differently than you treat any other guest

that books a room through your own or any third-party booking or distribution channels. This includes, without limitation, the handling of

overbookings; allocation of room types; size or floor of rooms; level of customer service available with the booked room type and, with respect

to your own Online Public booking or distribution channels, the amenities available with the booked room type and the amount of any Hotel

Fees. Additionally, your communications with guests regarding Bookings will not disparage Expedia or state that Expedia booki ngs are not

entitled to the same benefits, amenities, and service as bookings through your own channels.



2. Cancellation. You agree that the cancellation and no-show policies you offer through the Expedia System will be at least as favorable as

any cancellation or no-show policies offered by you through your own Online Public booking or distribution channels. Regardless of your

cancellation policy, you also agree that you will permit cancellations of Bookings at no charge where required by law. Withou t limiting Expedia’s

other cancellation rights, Expedia may cancel a Booking within the cancellation window of your cancellation policy. Expedia may also permit

cancellation by a guest at any time where required by applicable law. Except as made available to you in Expedia Partner Cent ral, you will not

cancel any Booking or encourage guests to cancel Bookings. If you do not enter your cancellation policy into Expedia Partner Central, Expedia’s

default cancellation policy will apply. Expedia is entitled to the Compensation Percentage of any amounts charged to guests for no-shows,

cancellations or similar booking modifications. Subject to the previous sentence, in the event of a guest cancellation or no -show for a Hotel

Collect Booking, Expedia will be entitled to the Compensation for each room night of such booking unless you notify Expedia of the no-show or

cancellation as specified in Expedia Partner Central.



3. Relocations. Without limiting your other obligations under this Agreement, if you are unable to honor a Booking, you will immediat ely

(i) relocate the impacted guest to a comparable property with an equivalent or higher Expedia star class rating, (ii) pay all room charges at such

property, all transportation to the property, and all other relocation costs, (iii) waive any additional amounts that would otherwise be payable to

you by Expedia or the guest as a result of the Booking, and (iv) notify Expedia that you are unable to honor the Booking. If you do not re locate

the guest as required in this Section: (a) Expedia may relocate the guest itself or refund amounts paid by the guest for the Booking, in which case

you will reimburse Expedia for all expenses (including any Taxes) paid or incurred by Expedia in relation to the relocation o r refund such as room

charges at an alternative property and other relocation costs, and (b) if your inability to honor the Booking was due to an overbooking situation,

Expedia will also be entitled to amounts that it would have been owed for the Booking under this Agreement (e.g. its Compensation) even

though the guest did not stay at your property. Any amount due to Expedia under this Section must be paid within 14 days of receipt of Expedia’s

written request.

4. Complaints. You will respond to any guest complaints relating to your Property promptly and reasonably. If a guest cancels all or part of

a Booking as a result of dissatisfaction with your accommodations or services, Expedia may refund any amounts paid by the guest for the

Booking, and you will reimburse Expedia for any refunded amounts within 14 day s of receipt of Expedia’s written request.



5. Health and Safety. If requested by Expedia, you will promptly provide Expedia with a copy of your operating license and/or similar

certificate(s), indicating your compliance with the health and safety obligations required for you to operate legally in the jurisdictions in which

you operate. Expedia may provide you with a health and safety self-assessment questionnaire from time to time, and you promptly will supply

the information requested. You will permit any Expedia representative to carry out health and safety reviews of the Property. As a result of a

selfassessment or a health and safety review, if Expedia recommends health and safety enhancements or changes for the Propert y, you agree

that you will implement these recommendations within a timeframe to be mutually agreed by you and Expedia. If you fail to comply with your

obligations under this Section, Expedia may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to you.



6. Anti-Fraud Cooperation. You agree that you are solely responsible for ensuring that the identification presented by any guest is valid

and matches the Booking information provided to you by Expedia. If you or Expedia believes a Booking may be or is fraudulent, or certain data

provided by a guest cannot be verified, then you and Expedia will work in good faith to address such fraudulent or potentially fraudulent

Booking. In the event of a fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Booking, Expedia may cancel such Booking at any time. If canc ellation of a

fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Expedia Collect Booking, Package Booking or Opaque Booking occurs prior to or within 2 hours after check-

in, neither Expedia nor any of its Affiliates will pay any cancellation fee or penalty. If the cancellation of a fraudulent or potentially fraudulent

Expedia Collect Booking, Package Booking or Opaque Booking occurs after the 2 hour period following check-in, the maximum penalty that you

may charge Expedia will be the relevant EC Remittance or Package Remittance for the room, up to and including the date such booking was

cancelled, plus any applicable Taxes. Neither Expedia nor any of its Affiliates will have any liability to you in connection with any fraudulent or

potentially fraudulent Hotel Collect Bookings.



E. LOADING AND DISPLAY OF RATES AND INFORMATION



1. Expedia Partner Central. You will use Expedia Partner Central to enter or modify all relevant information relating to Rates, availability,

applicable Tax rates, Hotel Fees, Property and Room Information, cancellation and no show policies, and/or to modify your account information

as permitted or required under this Agreement. You are responsible for the accuracy of all facts and information related to or provided by you

that are entered into Expedia Partner Central or displayed on the Expedia System. You will advise Expedia immediately if any such information

(including information related to your Property) is incomplete or inaccurate. Your use of your own or a third-party tool to interface with Expedia

Partner Central does not modify your obligations under this Agreement. During the Term, you will have access to info rmation provided or

generated by you and information relating to your Property collected or generated by Expedia to the extent that this information is generally

available in Expedia Partner Central. The Expedia Partner Central privacy policy (currently located at

https://welcome.expediagroup.com/en/privacy-policy) will apply to Expedia’s storage and use of this information.



2. Rate Information. You authorize Expedia to calculate on your behalf and in accordance with this Agreement, the Rates (as well as Room

Prices), together with any Hotel Fees, Taxes, or other amounts payable, based on information entered by you through Expedia Partner Central

(or otherwise provided by you to Expedia in a manner acceptable to Expedia) and Expedia deriving Rates, Hotel Fees, Taxes, or other amounts on

your behalf will be deemed to be your action, for purposes of this Agreement. You will immediately notify Expedia if you beli eve Expedia has

incorrectly derived any amounts relating to your rooms. You will honor all Bookings made at the Rate in

Expedia Partner Central and at the Room Price (together with any Hotel Fees and/or Taxes) shown on the Expedia System at the time the Booking

was made, including Bookings with stay-dates occurring after the termination of this Agreement. You will update the Rates, applicable Tax rates

and Hotel Fees (or the information entered by you necessary for Expedia to derive them) as necessary and in accordance with t his Agreement.

You will not unlawfully increase your Rates or Hotel Fees in reaction to an actual or potential Force Majeure Event. You will not require guests to

pay any fees or charges relating to their payment method.



3. Intellectual Property. You grant Expedia and its Affiliates the worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license, in all

media now known or later discovered or developed, to use, reproduce, distribute and display the Property and Room Information for purposes

of identifying, promoting, merchandising and/or obtaining bookings for the Property. In addition, you will provide Expedia reasonable free access

to the Property in order to obtain images for purposes of identifying, promoting, merchandising and/or obtaining bookings for the Property. You

represent and warrant that you and/or the Property are the owner or authorized licensee of all Property and Room Information and that such

content, and Expedia’s and its Affiliates’ use, reproduction, distribution and display of such content, does n ot and will not violate the rights of any

third-party. Any additional advertising or marketing that Expedia performs for you or the Property will be governed by Expedia’s then -standard

marketing terms and conditions. Expedia may remove or edit any Property or Room Information that Expedia believes to be inaccurate or

inappropriate. This Agreement does not grant to you or the Property any ownership interest in, or any express or implied lice nse or right to, the

Expedia System or to any software or intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to Expedia or its Affiliates. You will provide Expedia with

Property and Room Information under this Agreement that is equal to or better than what you make available through your own o r any third-

party booking or distribution channels.

rating assigned to the Property and Expedia may change the star class rating from time to time in its sole discretion. To the extent you have an

officially mandated star class rating, you will provide that star class rating, and its source, to Expedia.



5. Display; Special Programs and Discounts. Expedia will determine the order that Rooms displayed on the Expedia System appear in its

sole discretion. Further details can be found on the Expedia Group lodging partner resource website. In addition, you agree Expedia and its

Affiliates may also on occasion offer discount pricing for your rooms; provided that (i) any such offers will be available with respect to a broad

number of properties and not limited to your Property; and (ii) unless otherwise agreed to with respect to any particular off er, Expedia will fund

any such discount by a reduction to the Compensation otherwise payable by you to Expedia or retained by Expedia. You agree that Expedia and

its Affiliates may offer benefits to guests through their respective loyalty programs or through customer service coupons.



F. CONFIDENTIALITY; PERSONAL DATA



1. Confidentiality. The Parties will use any confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information of any Party in any form that is designated

as “confidential” or that a person reasonably should understand to be confidential (“Confidential Information”) only as specifically permitted by

the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Without the express written consent of the Party whose information will be disclosed, during and after the Term, no Party wil l disclose or allow

the disclosure of any Confidential Information of another Party to any third-party, except that a Party may disclose Confidential Information to its

written agreement sufficient to enable compliance with this Section. For the avoidance of doubt, “Confidential Information” of Expedia includes,

but is not limited to, information (i) provided by a guest to Expedia in connection with any Booking, or (ii) provided b y Expedia or any of its

highest level of protection available and provide us with reasonable advance notice. All Confidential Information will remain the exclusive

property of the disclosing Party.



2. Personal Data and Security . Each Party agrees that it has in place and will maintain, adequate security procedures and controls to

prevent the unintended disclosure of, and the unauthorized access to or

misappropriation of, any personal data or information of any guest. Each Party agrees that it will process, store, transmit, and access any guest

information in compliance with applicable law and, for guest information that includes payment information (including, withou t limitation, credit

card, debit card, or financial account information), will do so in compliance with the current Payment Card Information Data Security Standard

(“PCI DSS”). Unless you receive consent directly from the guest, you and your affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, engage in any solicited or

unsolicited marketing, promotional, or similar communications with any guest that has booked a room through the Expedia System.



3. Compliance with Laws. Each Party will comply with all laws applicable to its business and operations. You will obtain all licenses

required for you to operate legally in the jurisdictions in which you operate. You acknowledge that Expedia provides bookings fo r multiple

properties and has no duty to segregate any amounts collected by Expedia from guests under this Agreement. This Agreement does not create a

partnership or joint venture relationship between or among the Parties.



G. ADDITIONAL TERMS



1. Indemnification. Expedia agrees, at its expense, to indemnify and defend you and any of your officers, directors, employees, or agents

(“your Indemnitees”) against any third-party claim or action; such indemnity to be limited to the loss, damage, expense or other liability

(including without limitation, legal fees and expenses) directly incurred by your Indemnitees from that third-party claim or action and to apply

only where such claim or action arose from breach or default by Expedia under this Agreement, including, without limitation, a breach of any

the intellectual property rights of any third-party. You will use counsel reasonably satisfactory to Expedia to defend any indemnified claim, and

Expedia may participate in the defense or settlement of any claim at any time using counsel selected by Expedia. You also agree not to consent to

amounts received by you for any Bookings and/or in consideration for your services. On request, you will provide Expedia with documentation to

substantiate registration with and/or remittance of Taxes to the relevant taxing authorities. The Compensation does not include any Taxes, and

where such Tax applies it will be paid to Expedia by you or retained by Expedia, as applicable. You will pay all amounts owed to Expedia in cleared

funds, without any deduction set-off, or withholdings of any kind. If you are required to make such a deduction or withholding, you agree that

the amount paid to Expedia will not be less than the amount that Expedia would have received had no deduction or withholding been required.

Form W-9 or other applicable documentary evidence satisfactory to Expedia to establish that you are not subject to withholding or ar e entitled

to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax, as applicable. You will promptly notify Expedia of any change in circumstances which

would cause you to be subject to withholding or modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction of withholding tax, and take any

action that may be necessary to avoid any requirement that Expedia make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to you.

If you fail to perform your obligations under this Section, then Expedia may deduct and withhold from any payment to you such amounts as it is

required to withhold under applicable law. All amounts withheld pursuant to this Section will be treated as paid to you for purposes of this

Agreement.

failure results from a Force Majeure Event. A Party whose performance is impaired as a result of a Force Majeure Event will p romptly notify the

other Party. If a Force Majeure Event impacts a guest’s ability to stay at your Property: (i) you will not charge to the guest (and will refund, if

applicable) any amounts related to portions of a Booking that are unstayed as a result of the Force Majeure Event, (ii) Expedia may refund some

or all of the amounts paid by the guest for any such unstayed portions of the Booking and/or may relocate a guest pursuant to Section D.3, and

practice. To the extent permitted by law, you will either (i) provide evidence of insurance acceptable to Expedia that indicates, in the event of a

claim relating to this Agreement, that Expedia or claims made by Expedia, will be covered by your insurance, or (ii) name Exp edia as an additional

the preceding clause. You will cause Expedia to receive 30 days prior written notice before your insurance is cancell ed or expires. No later than

10 working days prior to the date of cancellation or expiration of an existing insurance policy, you will deliver new certificates (or other evidence)

of insurance to Expedia for any renewal policies. Expedia may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to you if you fail to

comply with this Section.



6. Governing Law; Arbitration; Venue. This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law without

giving effect to any conflict of law principles. Each Party consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts for all disputes arising out of

or relating to this Agreement.

8. Disputes; Other Charges. If a dispute arises under this Agreement (including any dispute regarding termination or suspension), the

disputing Party will promptly provide written notice with reasonable detail regarding the dispute. Upon receipt of a dispute notice, the parties

will work together in good faith to resolve the matter within a reasonable time period. If you are located in the European Un ion, the disputing

party may refer the matter to mediation through Expedia Lodging Mediation Program. Until the dispute has been resolved in a manner

satisfactory to the parties, you will not (i) apply any payment received for any other Booking or invoice (o r amounts owed to Expedia for Hotel

Collect Bookings) to the disputed Booking or invoice, (ii) charge or attempt to charge the guest directly for the disputed amount, or (iii) refuse to

honor or otherwise interfere with any guest’s Booking. If Expedia determines that your actions or performance may result in chargebacks, claims,

disputes, fraud, or other risks to guests, Expedia may in its reasonable discretion withhold any payments to you.



9. Books and Records. Expedia’s books and records including without limitation, any information contained in Expedia Partner Central or

the Expedia System, or in any electronic communication submitted by you or Expedia, is evidence of the receipt by you of Bookings made by

guests through the Expedia System and the amount of the applicable Compensation, EC Remittance or Package Remittance. You acknowledge

that Expedia generally has no knowledge of (i) guests’ actual arrival or departure dates, (ii) any cancellation notice that may be given by guests

directly to you, or whether any such cancellation notice as may be given is sufficient under your policies to relieve guests (and Expedia) of all or

any portion of the charges otherwise due to you, or (iii) any adjustment that may be negotiated by you directly with guests r egarding reductions

in rate, duration of stay, or otherwise. Accordingly, you agree that Expedia and its Affiliates are entitled to rely upon and accept as accurate any

information relating to Bookings received by Expedia from you.



10. Limitations. Expedia may, at any time and for any reason (or no reason), elect not to offer, display, or list for booking any of your rooms

Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Expedia will not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or other consequential

damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or for any direct or indirect lost profits or revenue or business, or lost or corrupted data or

lost anticipated savings or goodwill or reputation, including costs or expenses (including legal fees and expenses). Except as expressly described

in this Agreement, no Party makes any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and each Party specifically

disclaims all implied warranties, including any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum ext ent permitted

by applicable law. Nothing in this Agreement limits or excludes either Party’s liability for fraud, death or personal injury caused by negligence,

any other liability which cannot be limited by law, or any liability it has under an express obligation in this Agreement to indemnify the other

Party.



11. Termination. In addition to the termination rights elsewhere in this Agreement, Expedia may terminate all or part of this Agreement if

Expedia determines (i) you have materially breached this Agreement and failed to cure that material breach within 30 days’ no tice, unless your

breach exposes Expedia or its Affiliates to liability toward a third-party or your breach is a repeated breach, in which case the cure period will not

apply, (ii) you have not met your payment obligations under this Agreement or any other agreement with Expedia and fail to cure that breach

within 30 days’ notice, or (iii) your use of the Expedia System is associated with fraudulent or illegal activity or might otherwise harm othe r

by law. Expedia may also suspend your access to the Expedia System at any time and in its sole discretion, for whatever reaso n (including without

cause). Expedia will notify you of any termination or suspension and, where relevant, give you reasons for the termination or suspension.

Additionally, either you or Expedia may terminate this Agreement for any reason by providing at least 30 days prior written n otice to the other.

conditions, you may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Expedia. Your failure to exercise your right to terminate this Agreement

within 30 days after notice of any change to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of such changes. You agree that the termination right

provided in this Section does not apply to updates to the definition of “Expedia” or, if applicable to you, to updates to the Co nnectivity Terms.

You may not modify this Agreement without Expedia’s prior written consent.



14. Assignment and Change of Ownership. No Party may assign or otherwise transfer (whether voluntary or involuntary, or by operation of

TERMS AND CONDITIONS



A. EXPEDIA COLLECT AND PROPERTY COLLECT BOOKINGS



1. Compensation. For each night covered by a Standalone Booking, Expedia will be entitled to compensation (the

“Compensation”) equal to the Compensation Percentage of the Reservation Price and Property Fees. The Parties

agree that the Compensation may be increased at Your discretion.



2. Expedia Collect Bookings. For each Expedia Collect Booking, Expedia will act as a facilitator of such booking on

Your behalf, but acting in its own name. In this capacity, Expedia will collect advance payments from guests at the

time of such booking. For each Expedia Collect Booking, You will be entitled to an amount equal to the Reservation

Price minus the Compensation (the “EC Remittance”). For each Expedia Collect Booking, Expedia shall remit to

Property Manager the EC Remittance and Taxes (except for Taxes that Expedia pays, or will pay, directly to the

applicable Tax authorities) paid by the guest, in the manner described in Section A.3.



3. Payments for Expedia Collect Bookings. You may collect amounts due with respect to Expedia Collect Bookings

using an electronic invoicing process implemented by Expedia and made available to You. In the event Expedia

makes available to You, and You elect to use, a single-use credit card system, then upon processing an Expedia

Collect Booking, Expedia will notify You and provide You with a single-use credit card. Following the guest’s

checkout or, subject to Section C.3.b, after the guest's cancellation or no-show, You will promptly charge such credit

card for the EC Remittance and Taxes (except Taxes that Expedia pays, or will pay, directly to the applicable Tax

authority). In the event Expedia makes available to You and You elect to use an alternate electronic invoicing

process, then for each Expedia Collect Booking, You will provide Expedia an electronic invoice within twelve (12)

months after the date of check-out, cancellation or no-show. All invoices will be submitted electronically via

Expedia’s then-current invoicing system, or as otherwise directed by Expedia. Each invoice, will specify as a

separate item and/or amount, for each booking: the guest’s name, the Expedia booking ID, the check-in and check-

out dates and/or the dates of any cancellation or no-show, the applicable Rate(s), Property Fees and Taxes. Expedia

will remit all undisputed amounts within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice submitted electronically. If You do

not charge the relevant single-use credit card or invoice Expedia in accordance with this Section A.3 for any amounts

with respect to an Expedia Collect Booking within twelve (12) months of the date after check-out, cancellation or

no-show of such Expedia Collect Booking, then neither Expedia nor the relevant guest will have any further

obligation with respect to such Expedia Collect Booking. If You do not dispute the amount remitted by Expedia in

respect of any Expedia Collect Bookings within twelve (12) months of such remittance, then neither Expedia nor

the relevant guest will have any further obligation with respect to such Expedia Collect Booking. Expedia reserves

the right to make changes or updates to its invoicing system, payment methods and/or invoicing requirements at

any time.



4. Property Collect Bookings. For each Property Collect Booking, You permit bookings by guests with the relevant

Participating Property through the Expedia System, with You acting on behalf of the relevant Participating Property

and in Your own name, but Expedia will not collect any advance payments from guests at the time of such booking.

You acknowledge that You will be responsible for collecting the relevant Reservation Price, Taxes, Property Fees

and any other amounts or charges (to the extent, if any, not included in the Reservation Price but due and payable

from guests as described in the Expedia Interface) directly from guests at the time of check-out unless otherwise

agreed by the Parties. For each Property Collect Booking, You will pay to Expedia the relevant Compensation in the

manner described in Section A.5. It should be noted that the Expedia Interface and/or other Expedia resources

may refer to “Hotel Collect” and not contain any references to Property Collect. In such instances, references to

“Hotel Collect” should generally be understood to refer to Property Collect and the applicable terms of this

Agreement, as applicable.



5. Payments for Property Collect Bookings. Expedia will submit invoices for Property Collect Bookings to You

through Expedia’s then-current invoicing system. You agree that payment for all invoices for Property Collect

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 3 of 16

Contract 270 ROW ETP PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



Bookings shall be due upon receipt using one of the payment options available to You in the Expedia Interface. If

you are unable to access the Expedia Interface, Your payment method will be determined by Expedia and

communicated to You. You agree not to use a third party to process payments for Property Collect Bookings on

Your behalf without Expedia’s consent and Expedia may implement a fee in respect of any such use of a third party

payment processor. You agree that if your payment method results in Expedia incurring bank fees or other similar

charges, You will reimburse Expedia for such bank fees or similar charges. Payments not made within fifteen (15)

days of the date of the invoice may be subject to late charges equal to 2%, or the maximum amount permitted by

law, whichever is lower, of the outstanding balance for each month (or portion thereof) the payment is overdue.

Unless You notify Expedia of a no-show or cancellation of a Property Collect Booking, or a change to a Property

Collect Booking, in the manner and within the time period set forth in the Expedia Interface, as the same may be

updated by Expedia from time to time, Expedia shall be entitled to, and shall invoice You for, Compensation on the

entire length of stay of such Property Collect Booking as booked through the Expedia System. Expedia also may

contact guests to confirm the accuracy of any documentation submitted by You in connection with any such notice.

Expedia reserves the right to make changes or updates to its invoicing system, payment methods and/or invoicing

requirements at any time.



6. No Additional Expenditures. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the amounts received or retained by

Expedia under this Agreement adequately cover the services Expedia has agreed to provide in accordance with this

Agreement. The Parties further acknowledge that Expedia will not incur any exceptional and/or additional

expenditure relating to any of Your Bookings without Your prior agreement to reimburse Expedia fully for any such

exceptional and/or additional expenditure.



B. FENCED BOOKINGS



1. Package and Opaque Bookings. You agree that for each Rate Plan for Expedia Collect Bookings and Property

Collect Bookings You provide, Expedia will create for You (or You will create) a Rate Plan for Package Bookings.

Except as set forth herein, Expedia may offer any Property (as made available by You under this Agreement) for

reservation as a Package Booking, and any Property that is made available as a Package Booking may be offered to

guests for reservation as an Opaque Booking. The Parties agree that the Fenced Booking Percentage for Package

Bookings and Opaque Bookings may be increased at Your discretion. For each reserved night covered by a Package

Booking or Opaque Booking, Expedia will remit to You the Package Remittance and Taxes (except for Taxes that

Expedia pays, or will pay, directly to the applicable Tax authority) paid by the guest. You may enforce black-out

dates or other availability restrictions on Rates or Rate Plans for Package Bookings based on Your revenue

management strategy in the manner provided through the Expedia Interface, so long as these availability

restrictions are properly communicated to Expedia in advance. You may discontinue participation in Opaque

Bookings by providing ten (10) days written notice to Expedia.



2. Standalone Fenced Bookings. You agree that for each Rate Plan for Expedia Collect Bookings and Property

Collect Bookings You provide, Expedia will create on Your behalf (or You will create) a Rate Plan for Standalone

Fenced Bookings. Each Standalone Fenced Booking Rate Plan will be the Rate Plan applicable to the corresponding

Expedia Collect Booking or Property Collect Booking reduced by the Fenced Booking Percentage. The Parties agree

that the Fenced Booking Percentage for Standalone Fenced Bookings may be increased at Your discretion. For each

reserved night covered by a Standalone Fenced Booking, You will be entitled to an amount equal to the Standalone

Fenced Booking Reservation Price reduced by the Compensation, plus Taxes (except for Taxes that Expedia pays,

or will pay, directly to the applicable Tax authority) paid by the guest. You may enforce black-out dates or other

availability restrictions on Rates or Rate Plans for Standalone Fenced Bookings based on Your revenue management

strategy in the manner provided through the Expedia Interface, so long as these availability restrictions are properly

communicated to Expedia in advance. You may discontinue participation in Standalone Fenced Bookings by opting

out in the manner provided through the Expedia Interface.

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 4 of 16

Contract 270 ROW ETP PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



3. Payments for Fenced Bookings. Expedia will collect advance payments from guests at the time of booking for

Package and Opaque Bookings. You may collect amounts due with respect to Package or Opaque Bookings in the

same manner You collect amounts due for Expedia Collect Bookings. For Standalone Fenced Bookings, collection

of payment from guests and payments to or from Expedia will occur according to the applicable booking type, i.e.,

Expedia Collect or Property Collect.



C. GENERAL TERMS



1. Term. The term of this Agreement begins on the Effective Date and will remain in effect unless

terminated by either You or Expedia as provided in the Agreement.



2. Rates and Availability.

a. Availability. The Parties agree that Expedia will be permitted to make Participating Properties available for

booking in its discretion as Expedia Collect Bookings, Property Collect Bookings, and/or Fenced Bookings.

b. Rates. You agree that the Rates and Rate Plans You provide to Expedia will be equal to or better than those

made available through Your own or any third-party booking or distribution channels, except in respect of

Designated Country Properties, if applicable, with respect to which the Rate Plans Properties provide to Expedia for

booking by guests through the Expedia System will be equal to or better than those made available through

Properties’ own Online Public booking or distribution channels. Any rules, restrictions, policies, and/or conditions

(including rules associated with cancellation) applicable to any Rate You make available through the Expedia System

shall be no more restrictive than those applicable to any comparable rate that You make available through Your

own or any third-party booking or distribution channels, except in respect of Designated Country Properties, if

applicable, with respect to which such rules, restrictions, policies and/or conditions shall be no more restrictive

than those applicable to any comparable accomodation that the relevant Property makes available through

Properties’ own Online Public booking or distribution channels. Providing Expedia with competitive rates, rules,

restrictions, policies and conditions is part of a fair and balanced commercial bargain between you and Expedia,

one which delivers incremental bookings to you on attractive terms (including importantly at no upfront costs), and

one which allows Expedia to provide a comprehensive search and booking service to guests, while protecting

Expedia from free-riding on its considerable investments in attracting guests to the Participating Properties. Subject

to Sections B.2, C.4.b and C.4.e, and unless otherwise agreed, You instruct Expedia not to display Expedia Collect or

Property Collect Bookings with a Reservation Price lower than the relevant Best Available Rate or, in the case of

Standalone Fenced Bookings, not to display with a Reservation Price lower than the relevant Best Available Rate

reduced by the Fenced Booking Percentage. Subject to Sections C.4.b and C.4.e, and unless otherwise agreed, You

instruct Expedia not to display Package Bookings or Opaque Bookings with a Reservation Price lower than the

Package Remittance. Subject to the foregoing sentence, You acknowledge that Expedia will determine the total

price of any Package Booking at its sole discretion.



3\. Guest Experience.

a. Guest Experience. You acknowledge that You will not treat any guest that books through the Expedia System

differently than You treat any other guest that books through Your own or any third-party booking or distribution

channels, including, without limitation, with respect to the handling of overbooking situations, the provision of

customer service and, except in respect of Designated Country Properties, if applicable, the amenities available or

the amount and charging of Property Fees. Designated Country Properties shall not treat any guest that books

through the Expedia System differently than it treats any other guest that books through Properties’ own Online

Public booking or distribution channels in respect of amenities available or the amount and charging of Property

Fees and/or credit or debit card fees or surcharges to the extent that such fees or surcharges are permitted

pursuant to Section C.4.b.

b. Cancellation; No Shows; Regulatory Cancellations. You agree that Your cancellation and no-show policies

offered through the Expedia System will (i) be at least as favorable as any cancellation or no show policies offered

by You through Your own Online Public or any third-party booking or distribution channels and (ii) comply with

applicable laws, if any, in the jurisdictions where the relevant Participating Properties are located. Subject to the

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 5 of 16

Contract 270 ROW ETP PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



terms and conditions of Your relevant cancellation policy, Expedia reserves the right to cancel a Booking at any

time. Except as may be made available to You in the Expedia Interface, You shall not cancel any Booking and shall

not encourage guests to cancel Bookings. If You have not entered Your cancellation policies into the Expedia

Interface, Expedia’s default cancellation policy will apply. Expedia is entitled to the Compensation Percentage of

any penalty amounts charged to guests for no-shows, cancellations or similar booking modifications. If Expedia

cancels all or part of a Booking to comply with applicable Short Term Rental Laws or any other applicable laws, You

agree to (i) waive any and all terms and conditions of Your relevant cancellation policy and (ii) reimburse Expedia

for all expenses (including any Taxes) incurred by Expedia in securing alternative arrangements for the affected

guest, including applicable charges at the alternative property and associated guest relocation costs.

c. Relocations. If You are, or reasonably believe that You will be, unable to honor a Booking, You agree that You

will immediately (i) notify Expedia of such inability, (ii) relocate the affected guest to a comparable property (i.e.

within the original booking area, with sleeping accommodations for the same or a greater number of guests, the

same or a greater number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and with similar amenities) and with the same star class

or equivalent classification rating, if applicable, (iii) pre-pay or make other arrangements to cover the charges at

such property for the nights in question and all transportation and associated relocation costs to such property,

and (iv) waive any additional fees or other payments that would otherwise be payable to You by Expedia or the

guest as a result of the Booking. Expedia reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to perform items (ii) and/or (iii)

above directly, in which case You agree to reimburse Expedia for all expenses (including any Taxes) incurred by

Expedia in securing such alternative arrangements, including applicable charges at the alternative property and

associated guest relocation costs.

d. Complaints. You agree to respond to any guest complaints relating Your Property in a prompt and reasonable

manner. If a guest cancels all or part of a Booking as a result of dissatisfaction with Your accommodations or

services, Expedia may refund some or all of the amounts paid by such guest for such Booking, and You will reimburse

Expedia for any such refunded amounts within thirty (30) days of receipt of written request for reimbursement.

and preferred payment and notice practices. You acknowledge and agree that Facility Policies shall comply with all

applicable laws and shall not significantly limit a guest’s reasonable use and enjoyment of the relevant Participating

Property. Expedia may restrict or condition the use of Facility Policies at any time and/or require that specific

information related to Facility Policies be entered into the Expedia Interface (or otherwise provided by You to

Expedia in a manner acceptable to Expedia). Expedia may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section

C.6.l. with respect to specific Participating Properties or Property Manager, as applicable, if Expedia determines, in

its sole discretion, that the applicable Facility Policies do not comply with the requirements set forth in this Section

C.4.a. You acknowledge that You are responsible for the accuracy of all facts and information You provide to

Expedia regarding the Participating Properties. In no event shall Expedia be liable for the content of information

provided by You to Expedia. You agree to advise Expedia immediately if any such information is incomplete or

inaccurate. You must also advise Expedia immediately if, for any reason, any Participating Property is no longer, or

facts arise that will or may cause any Participating Property not to be managed by or otherwise represented by You

for purposes of this Agreement. During the Term, you will have access to information provided or generated by you

and information relating to the Properties collected or generated by Expedia to the extent that this information is

generally available in the Expedia Interface. The Expedia Interface privacy policy (currently located at

https://welcome.expediagroup.com/en/privacy-policy) will apply to Expedia’s storage and use of this information.

You will submit to Expedia a fully-completed Merchant Payment Information Form and any additional information

required by any future updates to such form for each Property. In the event of a change of Property ownership

that terminates Your right to represent or legally bind the relevant Property or requires any change to the

relevant Participating Property, You will (i) update such information through the Expedia Interface and/or by

submitting an updated Merchant Payment Information Form, as applicable, or if You are unable to update such

You shall cause each Property to agree to become a Participating Property under this Agreement. You acknowledge

and agree that You shall take all actions needed to ensure each Participating Property’s proper and prompt

performance of the terms and conditions set forth herein, including without limitation prompt enforcement of any

and all contracts or arrangements pursuant to which You are authorized to instruct Expedia to make Participating

Properties available under this Agreement. In the event a Participating Property fails to perform any obligation

under this Agreement, Property Manager shall be responsible for such non-performance and shall take whatever

actions may be necessary to promptly cure any such non-performance.

b. Rate Information. You acknowledge that You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the information that

You enter into the Expedia Interface. You authorize Expedia to ascertain in accordance with this Agreement, the

Rates (as well as the Reservation Prices), together with any Property Fees or other amounts payable, based on

information entered by You through the Expedia Interface (or otherwise provided by You to Expedia in a manner

acceptable to Expedia). Any action by Expedia to derive Rates, Property Fees, Taxes or other amounts on Your

behalf shall be deemed to be Your action, for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You

acknowledge that You will immediately notify Expedia if You believe that Expedia has incorrectly derived any Rates,

Reservation Prices, Property Fees, Taxes or other amounts relating to any Property. You agree to honor all Bookings

made during the Term at the Rate in the Expedia Interface and at the Reservation Price (together with any Property

Fees and/or Taxes) shown on the Expedia System at the time such Booking occurred, including Bookings with stay-

dates occurring after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. You agree to update the Rates, Property

Fees, Taxes and other amounts entered into the Expedia Interface (or the information entered by each Participating

Property necessary for Expedia to derive them) as necessary and in accordance with this Agreement. You agree

that Your Rates and Property Fees will not unlawfully increase in reaction to the occurrence or threatened

occurrence of a Force Majeure Event. You accept that you will not require guests to pay any fees or surcharges

relating to their payment process or method (e.g., guests will not be charged any fees or surcharges for credit or

debit card payments), unless such fees or surcharges are specifically allowed by local law and notified to Expedia.

c. Merchandising; Intellectual Property. You grant Expedia and each of its Affiliates the worldwide, nonexclusive,

royalty-free, fully paid right and license, in any and all media now known or hereafter discovered or developed, to

use, reproduce, distribute, display, and prepare derivative works from the Property Information for purposes of

identifying, promoting, merchandising and/or obtaining Bookings for the Participating Properties. In addition, You

agree to provide Expedia Property Information through the Expedia Interface or as otherwise requested by Expedia.

You represent and warrant that You are the owner or authorized licensee of all of the Property Information and

that such content, and Expedia’s and any of its Affiliates’ use, reproduction, distribution and display of such content,

does not and will not violate the rights of any third party. To the extent Your consent is required for Expedia to

utilize the right and license above, You represent that You have all necessary rights and provide Your consent and

agree that Your consent may be shared directly with third parties. You shall not submit Property Information to

Expedia that is subject to limitations on term, type or nature of use, unless Expedia agrees to accept such Property

Information and provided that You agree to inform Expedia when such use is no longer permitted. Any additional

advertising or marketing to be performed for You shall be governed by Expedia’s then-standard marketing terms

and conditions. Expedia may remove any Property Information, or edit any Property Information that Expedia

believes to be inaccurate or inappropriate. This Agreement does not grant You any ownership interest in, or any

express or implied license or right to, any of the Materials or to any software or intellectual property rights owned

by or licensed to Expedia or any of its Affiliates. The Property Information You provide to Expedia under this

Agreement will be equal to or better than what You make available through Your own or any third-party booking

or distribution channels.

d. Classification Ratings. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, You agree that (i) Expedia will make the final

determination of any Expedia star class or equivalent classification rating assigned to a Participating Property, if

any, and (ii) an Expedia star class or equivalent classification rating assigned to a Participating Property may be

changed by Expedia from time to time in its sole discretion. To the extent any Participating Property has an officially

mandated star class or equivalent classification rating, You agree to provide such rating, and its source, to Expedia.

partner resource website. You agree Expedia and/or certain of its Affiliates may also on occasion offer discount

pricing for Participating Properties; provided, that (i) any such offers shall be available with respect to a broad

number of properties and not limited to a single Participating Property and (ii) to the extent You and Expedia have

not agreed otherwise with respect to any particular offer, any such discount will be funded by a reduction to the

Compensation otherwise payable by You to Expedia or retained by Expedia. At Your request and upon reasonable

notice, Expedia will meet with You to discuss any such offers and Your participation in them. You acknowledge and

agree that benefits offered to guests by Expedia and any of its Affiliates through their respective loyalty programs

or through customer service coupons shall not be a violation of this Agreement.



5\. Operational Matters.

a. Booking Process. Expedia will provide You notice of each Booking processed through the Expedia System. You

will provide Expedia confirmation of receipt of every Booking notification within forty-eight (48) hours of Expedia’s

notification being delivered to You. You must honor every Booking for which You receive a Booking notification.

b. Anti-Fraud Cooperation. You acknowledge that You are solely responsible for ensuring that the identification

presented by any guest is valid and matches the Booking information provided to You by Expedia. If the relevant

Participating Property does not have a front desk or other means to physically verify guest identification, You may

use other commercially reasonable methods to comply with Your obligations in the previous sentence, provided

that, any such alternative method shall comply with the requirements of Section C.5.c. of this Agreement. If a

Party believes a Booking may be or is fraudulent, or certain data provided by a guest cannot be verified, then the

Parties will work together in good faith to address such fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Booking. In the event

of a fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Booking, Expedia may cancel such Booking at any time. If cancellation of

a fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Expedia Collect Booking, Package Booking or Opaque Booking occurs prior to

or within two (2) hours after check-in, neither Expedia nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to pay any

cancellation fee or penalty. If the cancellation of a fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Expedia Collect Booking,

Package Booking or Opaque Booking occurs after such two (2) hour period following check-in, the maximum penalty

that may be charged to Expedia will be the relevant EC Remittance or Package Remittance for the Participating

Property, up to and including the date the Expedia Collect Booking, Package Booking or Opaque Booking was

cancelled, plus any applicable Taxes. You acknowledge that neither Expedia nor any of its Affiliates shall have any

liability to You in connection with any fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Property Collect Booking. If, as a result

of an investigation into a fraudulent Booking, Expedia recommends fraud prevention actions to You, You agree that

You will implement such recommendations within a reasonable timeframe.

c. Personal Data and Security. (i) Each Party agrees that it has in place and will maintain, or will establish and

maintain, adequate security procedures and controls to prevent the unintended disclosure of, and the unauthorized

access to or misappropriation of, any personal data or information of any guest. Each Party agrees that it will

process, store, transmit and access any guest information in compliance with applicable law and, for guest

information that includes payment information (including, without limitation, credit card, debit card, or financial

account information), will do so in compliance with the current Payment Card Information Data Security Standard

(“PCI DSS”). Unless You receive consent directly from the guest, You and Your affiliates will not directly or indirectly,

engage in any solicited or unsolicited marketing, promotional, or similar communications, with any guest that has

booked a Property through the Expedia System. (ii) This Section C.5.c.ii applies to circumstances where You are

responsible for charging and/or collecting payment from the guest for such Booking and Expedia possesses, stores,

processes, or transmits guests’ cardholder data on Your behalf, or to the extent that Expedia could impact the

security of Your cardholder data environment: Expedia acknowledges that Expedia is responsible for the security

of cardholder data that Expedia possesses, stores, processes or transmits and will comply with the PCI DSS as issued

by the PCI Security Standard Council, as updated from time to time.

d. Health and Safety. At Expedia’s request, You agree to promptly provide Expedia with copies of each

Participating Property’s operating licenses and/or similar certificates, if any, indicating the relevant Participating

Property’s compliance with the health and safety obligations, if any, required for the relevant Participating

Properties to operate legally in the jurisdictions in which such Participating Properties operate. In addition, Expedia

may provide You with a health and safety self-assessment questionnaire from time to time for some or all of the

Participating Properties, and You agree to supply the information requested in the self-assessment in a timely

manner. Further, You agree to permit any employee of or consultant appointed by Expedia to carry out health and

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 8 of 16

Contract 270 ROW ETP PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



safety reviews of any of the Participating Properties. If, as a result of a self-assessment or a health and safety

review, Expedia recommends health and safety enhancements or changes for any Property, You agree that You will

implement such recommendations within a timeframe to be mutually agreed upon by You and Expedia. In the

event that You fail to comply with Your obligations under this Section C.5.d, Expedia may terminate this Agreement

immediately with respect to specific Participating Properties or all Participating Properties, as applicable, upon

written notice to You.

e. Taxes. (i) Each Property acknowledges that it is solely responsible for the accuracy of Tax rate information, the

identification of applicable Taxes and any changes to the Tax rates entered into the Expedia Interface. You are

responsible for accounting to the applicable governmental authority for any Taxes applicable to any amounts

received by You with respect to any Bookings and/or in consideration for the services that You provide. Upon

request, You will provide documentation to substantiate Your registration with and/or remittance of Taxes to any

applicable governmental authority or to provide such other information or documentation as Expedia requests to

comply with its Tax obligations. Property Manager acknowledges that the Tax information entered into the Expedia

Interface is based on the Rate Property Manager provides to Expedia to facilitate a Booking. (ii) The Compensation

is exclusive of any sales, value-added, turnover, withholding or other transaction-based Tax, and where such Tax

applies, You shall pay the Compensation to Expedia, in the case of a Property Collect Booking, or it will be retained

by Expedia, in the case of an Expedia Collect Booking, as applicable. The Compensation shall be paid to Expedia in

cleared funds, without any deduction or set-off, and exclusive of and without any deduction for, or on account of,

any Taxes, or withholdings of any kind. In the event that You are required to make such a deduction or withholding,

You agree that the Compensation will not be less than the Compensation that Expedia would have received had no

deduction or withholding been required. (iii) If requested by Expedia, You will promptly provide Expedia with valid

Tax invoices in respect of any transactions entered into under this Agreement, where Taxes are chargeable under

applicable law. (iv) Property Manager shall deliver to Expedia, prior to receipt of any payment hereunder, a duly

completed and signed copy of IRS Form W-9, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor thereto)

to establish that it is not subject to withholding or is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding

tax, as applicable. Where Property Manager delivers to Expedia IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI (or any

successor thereto), Property Manager acknowledges that it is the beneficial owner of all payments from Expedia to

it under this Agreement for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Property Manager shall (A) promptly notify Expedia

of any change in circumstances that impacts the validity of the information previously provided, including that

which would cause Property Manager to be subject to withholding or modify or render invalid any claimed

exemption or reduction of withholding tax, and (B) take any action that may be necessary to avoid any requirement

that Expedia make any deduction or withholding for Taxes from amounts payable to Property Manager. Property

Manager shall provide Expedia with an updated version of IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor

thereto) every three years. If Property Manager fails to perform any of its obligations under this Section C.5.e, then

Expedia shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment to the relevant Property such amounts as

Expedia is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. All amounts withheld by Expedia pursuant to this

Section C.5.e shall be treated as paid to the relevant Property for purposes of Section A.3.



6\. Miscellaneous.

a. Confidentiality and Public Statements. The Parties agree that any confidential, proprietary, know-how or trade

secret information of any Party in any form that is designated as “confidential” or that a reasonable person knows

or reasonably should understand to be confidential (“Confidential Information”) will only be used for the purposes

of this Agreement. Without the express written consent of the Party whose Confidential Information will be

disclosed, during and after the Term, no Party will disclose or allow the disclosure of any Confidential Information

of another Party to any third party. Entities directly or indirectly controlled by Expedia, Inc. shall not be considered

third parties for the purpose of this Section C.6.a. Each Party may disclose Confidential Information to its

employees, directors, officers, agents, independent contractors and consultants (or to those of entities described

in the previous sentence) on a need-to-know basis, provided that the receiving Party shall ensure that such persons

are aware of and, shall require compliance with all the provisions of this Section C.6.a. For the avoidance of doubt,

“Confidential Information” includes, but is not limited to, information (i) provided by a guest in connection with

any Booking, or (ii) provided by Expedia or any of its Affiliates, or otherwise obtained by You, in connection with

this Agreement, including without limitation, the terms and conditions of this Agreement. “Confidential

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 9 of 16

Contract 270 ROW ETP PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



Information” does not include any information that (A) becomes publicly available without the receiving Party’s

breach of any obligation owed to the disclosing Party, (B) was known to the receiving Party prior to the disclosing

Party’s disclosure of such information, (C) became known to the receiving Party from a source other than the

disclosing Party where such source did not breach an obligation of confidentiality owed to the disclosing Party, or

(D) is independently developed by the receiving Party. A Party may disclose another Party’s Confidential

Information if required to do so to comply with a court order or other government demand; provided, that prior to

disclosure, You must seek the highest level of protection available and provide Expedia with reasonable advance

notice. All Confidential Information will remain the exclusive property of the disclosing Party. No Party shall issue

or participate in any press release or other public announcement, confirmation or statement regarding this

Agreement or the contents of this Agreement without the other Party’s prior written consent.

b. Disputes; Other Charges. If a dispute arises under this Agreement (including any dispute regarding termination

or suspension), the disputing party will promptly provide written notice with reasonable detail regarding the

dispute. Upon receipt of a dispute notice, the parties will work together in good faith to resolve the matter within

a reasonable time period. If you are located in the European Union, the disputing party may refer the matter to

mediation through Expedia Lodging Mediation Program. Until the dispute has been resolved in a manner

satisfactory to the Parties, You will not (i) apply any payment received for any other Booking or invoice (or amounts

owed to Expedia in respect of Property Collect Bookings) to a disputed Booking or invoice, (ii) charge or attempt to

charge a guest directly for a disputed amount, (iii) refuse to honor any guest’s Booking, or (iv) take any other action

likely to interfere with the fulfillment or enjoyment of any guest’s Booking. You are responsible for any changes or

services requested by a guest directly from You and You are solely responsible for collecting from the guest any

charges for such changes or services and such collection must be done in compliance with the requirements of

Section C.5.c above, as applicable.

c. Books and Records. Subject to the terms of this Section C.6.c, Expedia’s books and records with respect to this

Agreement, including without limitation, any information contained in the Expedia Interface or the Expedia System,

or in any facsimile or electronic communication submitted by You or Expedia, will constitute evidence of

Your receipt of Bookings made by guests through the Expedia System and the amount of the applicable

Compensation, EC Remittance or Package Remittance, as the case may be, in respect of such Bookings.

Furthermore, You acknowledge that Expedia generally has no knowledge of (i) guests’ actual arrival or departure

dates, (ii) any cancellation notice that may be given by guests directly to You, or whether any such cancellation

notice as may be given is sufficient under Your relevant policies to relieve guests (and Expedia) of all or any portion

of the charges otherwise due to You, or (iii) any adjustment that may be negotiated by You directly with guests with

respect to reductions in rate, duration of stay, or otherwise. Accordingly, You agree that Expedia and its Affiliates

shall be entitled to rely upon and accept as accurate any information relating to Bookings received by Expedia from

You.

d. Limitations. (i) Except as expressly described in this Agreement, no Party makes any warranties of any kind,

whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and each Party specifically disclaims all implied warranties,

including any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted

by applicable law. (ii) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude either Party’s liability for fraud, death or

personal injury caused by negligence, any other liability which cannot be limited by law, or any liability it has under

an express obligation in this Agreement to indemnify the other Party. (iii) Expedia may, at any time for any reason

(including no reason), elect not to offer, display, or list for booking any Participating Property made available by

You through the Expedia System. (iv) Expedia may change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspects of the Expedia

Interface, including its availability, at any time.(v) Expedia makes no representations or warranties regarding the

Expedia System or any Participating Property, including any temporary or permanent interruption of the operation

of the Expedia System, or with respect to the number, frequency, or type of accomodations booked through the

Expedia System. (vi) With respect to Bookings, nothing in this Agreement constitutes a sale or rental of any

Participating Property to or by Expedia.

breach of this Section C.6.f and any breach shall be deemed a material breach not capable of remedy and Expedia

may immediately terminate this Agreement.

g. Insurance. To the extent that Participating Properties are located in jurisdictions with Short Term Rental Laws

or other laws that require the relevant Participating Properties to be covered by liability or other types of insurance,

You represent and warrant that each such relevant Participating Property is covered by insurance which complies

with all such applicable laws. To the extent that Participating Properties are located in jurisdictions without legally-

mandated insurance requirements to operate legally, You represent and warrant that each relevant Participating

Property is covered by liability insurance coverage in an amount that is consistent with best industry practice. For

the avoidance of doubt, such liability insurance coverage must not exclude business activities and/or the renting,

arranging or recommending of any accommodations by or for others. To the extent permitted by law, You will

either (i) name Expedia as an additional insured on such liability insurance policies, and, deliver to Expedia

certificates of insurance that verify compliance with the preceding clause or (ii) provide other evidence of insurance

acceptable to Expedia. You will cause Expedia to receive thirty (30) days’ prior written notice before the termination

of such liability insurance. No later than ten (10) days prior to the termination date of such liability insurance

policies, You will deliver new certificates (or other evidence) of insurance to Expedia for liability insurance in effect

for each relevant Participating Property. Expedia may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice

to You if You fail to comply with this Section C.6.g.

officers, directors, employees, or agents (“Properties’ Indemnitees”) against any third-party claim or action; such

indemnity to be limited to the loss, damage, expense or other liability (including without limitation, attorneys’ fees

and expenses) directly incurred by Properties’ Indemnitees from that third-party claim or action and to apply only

where such claim or action arose from breach or default by Expedia under this Agreement, including, without

limitation, a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant. Properties agree, at Properties’ expense to

indemnify and defend Expedia, each of its Affiliates and any of Expedia’s or any of its Affiliates’ officers, directors,

or action arose from or relates to (i) Properties’ accommodations or services, (ii) the performance of Properties’

information provided by Properties in respect of a Participating Property, or (iv) any allegation that Expedia’s or

any of its Affiliates’ use, reproduction, distribution or display of the Property Information as permitted under this

Agreement infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of any third party. Properties agree to use

counsel reasonably satisfactory to Expedia to defend any indemnified claim, and Expedia may participate in the

or additional terms and conditions, You may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Expedia. Your failure

to exercise Your right to terminate this Agreement within thirty (30) days after notice of any modification or new

a third-party or your breach is a repeated breach, in which case the cure period will not apply, (ii) you have not met

your payment obligations under this Agreement or any other agreement with Expedia and fail to cure that breach

within 30 days’ notice, or (iii) your use of the Expedia System is associated with fraudulent or illegal activity or might

with respect to specific Participating Properties should any government regulatory entity or any of its agencies

require that Expedia be investigated, registered or licensed in any form. Expedia may immediately terminate all or

part of this Agreement or suspend your access to the Expedia System if required by law. Expedia may also suspend

your access to the Expedia System at any time and in its sole discretion, for whatever reason (including without

cause). Expedia will notify you of any termination or suspension and, where relevant, give you reasons for the

termination or suspension. Additionally, either you or Expedia may terminate this Agreement for any reason by

providing at least 30 days prior written notice to the other.

documentation to substantiate Your compliance with all such laws, including Short Term Rental Laws, if any.

Although Expedia has no obligation to notify You of any such laws or requirements, in the event that Expedia so

notifies You or requests that You take actions related to Your compliance with any laws, You will use commercially

reasonable efforts to cooperate with such requests and to comply with all applicable laws. In the event that You

fail to comply with any applicable laws, Expedia may terminate this Agreement immediately with respect to specific

Participating Properties or, in the case of Property Manager, all Properties, as applicable, upon written notice to

You. Subject to applicable law, Expedia reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide information relating to

any Participating Property or the Rates, Rate Plans, or any Bookings made by guests at any Participating Property

enforcement actions or other requests for information from such bodies. You acknowledge that Expedia provides

bookings for multiple properties, including Your competitors, and that Expedia has no obligation to disclose any

terms relating to Expedia’s relationship with other properties, and that Expedia does not have any duty to disclose

or segregate in any manner any amounts collected by Expedia from guests under this Agreement. This Agreement

is not intended to and does not create a partnership or joint venture relationship between or among the Parties. A

Party’s failure to perform under this Agreement, other than the obligations set forth in Section C.3.c, is excused if

the failure results from a Force Majeure Event. A Party whose performance is impaired as a result of a Force

Majeure Event shall promptly notify Expedia, in the case of Properties, or Property Manager, in the case of Expedia.

No Party may assign or otherwise transfer in any manner (whether voluntary or involuntary, or by operation of law,

sale of securities or assets, merger, reorganization or otherwise) this Agreement, or any of its rights or obligations

under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Expedia, in the case of Properties, or Property Manager,

in the case of Expedia; provided, however, that Expedia may assign any of its rights or obligations to any of its

Affiliates. Any purported assignment in contravention of the preceding sentence will be void and of no force or

effect. This Agreement is binding upon, and inures to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective permitted

successors and assigns. Only a Party to this Agreement, which includes such Party’s successors and permitted

assigns, shall have any right to enforce any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No provision in this

Agreement may be waived, unless such waiver is confirmed in writing and signed by Expedia and Property Manager.

If any part of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the

remainder of this

Agreement continues in effect. The language of this Agreement will be English and any translation of this

Agreement into a language other than English will be for reference purposes only. In the event of a conflict of

interpretation, the English language will prevail. Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties, all payments

contemplated under this Agreement will be made in a currency selected by Expedia. Sections A.1-A5, B.1-B.3, C.3.b-

d, C.4.a, C.4.c, C.5.b-c, C.5.e, C.6 and C.7, any other definitions, and any terms that, expressly state that they survive

TERMS AND CONDITIONS



A. EXPEDIA COLLECT BOOKINGS



1. Compensation. For each night covered by a Standalone Booking, Expedia will be entitled to compensation (the

“Compensation”) equal to the Compensation Percentage of the Reservation Price and Property Fees. The Parties

agree that the Compensation may be increased at Your discretion.



2. Expedia Collect Bookings. For each Expedia Collect Booking, Expedia will act as a facilitator of such booking on

Your behalf, but acting in its own name. In this capacity, Expedia will collect advance payments from guests at the

time of such booking. For each Expedia Collect Booking, You will be entitled to an amount equal to the Reservation

Price minus the Compensation (the “EC Remittance”). For each Expedia Collect Booking, Expedia shall remit to

Property Manager the EC Remittance and Taxes (except for Taxes that Expedia pays, or will pay, directly to the

applicable Tax authorities) paid by the guest, in the manner described in Section A.3.



3. Payments for Expedia Collect Bookings. You may collect amounts due with respect to Expedia Collect Bookings

using an electronic invoicing process implemented by Expedia and made available to You. In the event Expedia

makes available to You, and You elect to use, a single-use credit card system, then upon processing an Expedia

Collect Booking, Expedia will notify You and provide You with a single-use credit card. Following the guest’s

checkout or, subject to Section C.3.b, after the guest's cancellation or no-show, You will promptly charge such credit

card for the EC Remittance and Taxes (except Taxes that Expedia pays, or will pay, directly to the applicable Tax

authority). In the event Expedia makes available to You and You elect to use an alternate electronic invoicing

process, then for each Expedia Collect Booking, You will provide Expedia an electronic invoice within twelve (12)

months after the date of check-out, cancellation or no-show. All invoices will be submitted electronically via

Expedia’s then-current invoicing system, or as otherwise directed by Expedia. Each invoice, will specify as a

separate item and/or amount, for each booking: the guest’s name, the Expedia booking ID, the check-in and check-

out dates and/or the dates of any cancellation or no-show, the applicable Rate(s), Property Fees and Taxes. Expedia

will remit all undisputed amounts within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice submitted electronically. If You do

not charge the relevant single-use credit card or invoice Expedia in accordance with this Section A.3 for any amounts

with respect to an Expedia Collect Booking within twelve (12) months of the date after check-out, cancellation or

no-show of such Expedia Collect Booking, then neither Expedia nor the relevant guest will have any further

obligation with respect to such Expedia Collect Booking. If You do not dispute the amount remitted by Expedia in

respect of any Expedia Collect Bookings within twelve (12) months of such remittance, then neither Expedia nor

the relevant guest will have any further obligation with respect to such Expedia Collect Booking. Expedia reserves

the right to make changes or updates to its invoicing system, payment methods and/or invoicing requirements at

any time.



4. No Additional Expenditures. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the amounts retained by Expedia under

this Agreement adequately cover the services Expedia has agreed to provide in accordance with this Agreement.

The Parties further acknowledge that Expedia will not incur any exceptional and/or additional expenditure relating

to any of Your Bookings without Your prior agreement to reimburse Expedia fully for any such exceptional and/or

additional expenditure.



B. FENCED BOOKINGS



1. Package and Opaque Bookings. You agree that for each Rate Plan for Expedia Collect Bookings You provide,

Expedia will create for You (or You will create) a Rate Plan for Package Bookings. Except as set forth herein, Expedia

may offer any Property (as made available by You under this Agreement) for reservation as a Package Booking, and

any Property that is made available as a Package Booking may be offered to guests for reservation as an Opaque

Booking. The Parties agree that the Fenced Booking Percentage for Package Bookings and Opaque Bookings may

be increased at Your discretion. For each reserved night covered by a Package Booking or Opaque Booking, Expedia

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 3 of 14

Contract 269 ROW EC PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



will remit to You the Package Remittance and Taxes (except for Taxes that Expedia pays, or will pay, directly to the

applicable Tax authority) paid by the guest. You may enforce black-out dates or other availability restrictions on

Rates or Rate Plans for Package Bookings based on Your revenue management strategy in the manner provided

through the Expedia Interface, so long as these availability restrictions are properly communicated to Expedia in

advance. You may discontinue participation in Opaque Bookings by providing ten (10) days written notice to

Expedia.



2. Standalone Fenced Bookings. You agree that for each Rate Plan for Expedia Collect Bookings You provide,

Expedia will create on Your behalf (or You will create) a Rate Plan for Standalone Fenced Bookings. Each Standalone

Fenced Booking Rate Plan will be the Rate Plan applicable to the corresponding Expedia Collect Booking reduced

by the Fenced Booking Percentage. The Parties agree that the Fenced Booking Percentage for Standalone Fenced

Bookings may be increased at Your discretion. For each reserved night covered by a Standalone Fenced Booking,

You will be entitled to an amount equal to the Standalone Fenced Booking Reservation Price reduced by the

Compensation, plus Taxes (except for Taxes that Expedia pays, or will pay, directly to the applicable Tax authority)

paid by the guest. You may enforce black-out dates or other availability restrictions on Rates or Rate Plans for

Standalone Fenced Bookings based on Your revenue management strategy in the manner provided through the

Expedia Interface, so long as these availability restrictions are properly communicated to Expedia in advance. You

may discontinue participation in Standalone Fenced Bookings by opting out in the manner provided through the

Expedia Interface.



3. Payments for Fenced Bookings. Expedia will collect advance payments from guests at the time of booking for

Fenced Bookings. You may collect amounts due with respect to Fenced Bookings in the same manner You collect

amounts due for Expedia Collect Bookings.



C. GENERAL TERMS



1. Term. The term of this Agreement begins on the Effective Date and will remain in effect unless

terminated by either You or Expedia as provided in the Agreement.



2. Rates and Availability.

a. Availability. The Parties agree that Expedia will be permitted to make Participating Properties available for

booking in its discretion as Expedia Collect Bookings and/or Fenced Bookings.

b. Rates. You agree that the Rates and Rate Plans You provide to Expedia will be equal to or better than those

made available through Your own or any third-party booking or distribution channels, except in respect of

Designated Country Properties, if applicable, with respect to which the Rate Plans Properties provide to Expedia for

booking by guests through the Expedia System will be equal to or better than those made available through

Properties’ own Online Public booking or distribution channels. Any rules, restrictions, policies, and/or conditions

(including rules associated with cancellation) applicable to any Rate You make available through the Expedia System

shall be no more restrictive than those applicable to any comparable rate that You make available through Your

own or any third-party booking or distribution channels, except in respect of Designated Country Properties, if

applicable, with respect to which such rules, restrictions, policies and/or conditions shall be no more restrictive

than those applicable to any comparable accomodation that the relevant Property makes available through

Properties’ own Online Public booking or distribution channels. Providing Expedia with competitive rates, rules,

restrictions, policies and conditions is part of a fair and balanced commercial bargain between you and Expedia,

one which delivers incremental bookings to you on attractive terms (including importantly at no upfront costs), and

one which allows Expedia to provide a comprehensive search and booking service to guests, while protecting

Expedia from free-riding on its considerable investments in attracting guests to the Participating Properties. Subject

to Sections B.2, C.4.b and C.4.e, and unless otherwise agreed, You instruct Expedia not to display Expedia Collect

Bookings with a Reservation Price lower than the relevant Best Available Rate or, in the case of Standalone Fenced

Bookings, not to display with a Reservation Price lower than the relevant Best Available Rate reduced by the Fenced

Booking Percentage. Subject to Sections C.4.b and C.4.e, and unless otherwise agreed, You instruct Expedia not to

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 4 of 14

Contract 269 ROW EC PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



display Package Bookings or Opaque Bookings with a Reservation Price lower than the Package Remittance. Subject

to the foregoing sentence, You acknowledge that Expedia will determine the total price of any Package Booking at

its sole discretion.



3\. Guest Experience.

a. Guest Experience. You acknowledge that You will not treat any guest that books through the Expedia System

differently than You treat any other guest that books through Your own or any third-party booking or distribution

channels, including, without limitation, with respect to the handling of overbooking situations, the provision of

customer service and, except in respect of Designated Country Properties, if applicable, the amenities available or

the amount and charging of Property Fees. Designated Country Properties shall not treat any guest that books

through the Expedia System differently than it treats any other guest that books through Properties’ own Online

Public booking or distribution channels in respect of amenities available or the amount and charging of Property

Fees and/or credit or debit card fees or surcharges to the extent that such fees or surcharges are permitted

pursuant to Section C.4.b.

b. Cancellation; No Shows; Regulatory Cancellations. You agree that Your cancellation and no-show policies

offered through the Expedia System will (i) be at least as favorable as any cancellation or no show policies offered

by You through Your own Online Public or any third-party booking or distribution channels and (ii) comply with

applicable laws, if any, in the jurisdictions where the relevant Participating Properties are located. Subject to the

terms and conditions of Your relevant cancellation policy, Expedia reserves the right to cancel a Booking at any

time. Except as may be made available to You in the Expedia Interface, You shall not cancel any Booking and shall

not encourage guests to cancel Bookings. If You have not entered Your cancellation policies into the Expedia

Interface, Expedia’s default cancellation policy will apply. Expedia is entitled to the Compensation Percentage of

any penalty amounts charged to guests for no-shows, cancellations or similar booking modifications. If Expedia

cancels all or part of a Booking to comply with applicable Short Term Rental Laws or any other applicable laws, You

agree to (i) waive any and all terms and conditions of Your relevant cancellation policy and (ii) reimburse Expedia

for all expenses (including any Taxes) incurred by Expedia in securing alternative arrangements for the affected

guest, including applicable charges at the alternative property and associated guest relocation costs.

c. Relocations. If You are, or reasonably believe that You will be, unable to honor a Booking, You agree that You

will immediately (i) notify Expedia of such inability, (ii) relocate the affected guest to a comparable property (i.e.

within the original booking area, with sleeping accommodations for the same or a greater number of guests, the

same or a greater number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and with similar amenities) and with the same star class

or equivalent classification rating, if applicable, (iii) pre-pay or make other arrangements to cover the charges at

such property for the nights in question and all transportation and associated relocation costs to such property,

and (iv) waive any additional fees or other payments that would otherwise be payable to You by Expedia or the

guest as a result of the Booking. Expedia reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to perform items (ii) and/or (iii)

above directly, in which case You agree to reimburse Expedia for all expenses (including any Taxes) incurred by

Expedia in securing such alternative arrangements, including applicable charges at the alternative property and

associated guest relocation costs.

d. Complaints. You agree to respond to any guest complaints relating Your Property in a prompt and reasonable

manner. If a guest cancels all or part of a Booking as a result of dissatisfaction with Your accommodations or

services, Expedia may refund some or all of the amounts paid by such guest for such Booking, and You will reimburse

Expedia for any such refunded amounts within thirty (30) days of receipt of written request for reimbursement.



4\. Loading and Display of Rates and Information.

a. Participating Property Information and Expedia Interface; Merchant Payment Information; Performance by

Participating Properties. You agree to use the Expedia Interface to enter or modify all relevant information relating

to each Participating Property’s Rates, availability, applicable Tax rates, Property Fees, Property Information,

cancellation and no show policies, Facility Policies, and/or to provide or modify the relevant account information

and preferred payment and notice practices. You acknowledge and agree that Facility Policies shall comply with all

applicable laws and shall not significantly limit a guest’s reasonable use and enjoyment of the relevant Participating

Property. Expedia may restrict or condition the use of Facility Policies at any time and/or require that specific

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 5 of 14

Contract 269 ROW EC PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



information related to Facility Policies be entered into the Expedia Interface (or otherwise provided by You to

Expedia in a manner acceptable to Expedia). Expedia may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section

C.6.l. with respect to specific Participating Properties or Property Manager, as applicable, if Expedia determines, in

its sole discretion, that the applicable Facility Policies do not comply with the requirements set forth in this Section

C.4.a. You acknowledge that You are responsible for the accuracy of all facts and information You provide to

Expedia regarding the Participating Properties. In no event shall Expedia be liable for the content of information

provided by You to Expedia. You agree to advise Expedia immediately if any such information is incomplete or

inaccurate. You must also advise Expedia immediately if, for any reason, any Participating Property is no longer, or

facts arise that will or may cause any Participating Property not to be managed by or otherwise represented by You

for purposes of this Agreement. During the Term, you will have access to information provided or generated by you

and information relating to the Properties collected or generated by Expedia to the extent that this information is

generally available in the Expedia Interface. The Expedia Interface privacy policy (currently located at

https://welcome.expediagroup.com/en/privacy-policy) will apply to Expedia’s storage and use of this information.

You will submit to Expedia a fully-completed Merchant Payment Information Form and any additional information

required by any future updates to such form for each Property. In the event of a change of Property ownership

that terminates Your right to represent or legally bind the relevant Property or requires any change to the

information included in the Merchant Payment Information Form and/or the Expedia Interface relating to the

relevant Participating Property, You will (i) update such information through the Expedia Interface and/or by

submitting an updated Merchant Payment Information Form, as applicable, or if You are unable to update such

information through the Expedia Interface, (ii) You will provide fifteen (15) days written notice to Expedia of such

change, which notice shall be sent in accordance with the provisions included in Section C.6.i of this Agreement.

You shall cause each Property to agree to become a Participating Property under this Agreement. You acknowledge

and agree that You shall take all actions needed to ensure each Participating Property’s proper and prompt

performance of the terms and conditions set forth herein, including without limitation prompt enforcement of any

and all contracts or arrangements pursuant to which You are authorized to instruct Expedia to make Participating

Properties available under this Agreement. In the event a Participating Property fails to perform any obligation

under this Agreement, Property Manager shall be responsible for such non-performance and shall take whatever

actions may be necessary to promptly cure any such non-performance.

b. Rate Information. You acknowledge that You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the information that

You enter into the Expedia Interface. You authorize Expedia to ascertain in accordance with this Agreement, the

Rates (as well as the Reservation Prices), together with any Property Fees or other amounts payable, based on

information entered by You through the Expedia Interface (or otherwise provided by You to Expedia in a manner

acceptable to Expedia). Any action by Expedia to derive Rates, Property Fees, Taxes or other amounts on Your

behalf shall be deemed to be Your action, for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You

acknowledge that You will immediately notify Expedia if You believe that Expedia has incorrectly derived any Rates,

Reservation Prices, Property Fees, Taxes or other amounts relating to any Property. You agree to honor all Bookings

made during the Term at the Rate in the Expedia Interface and at the Reservation Price (together with any Property

Fees and/or Taxes) shown on the Expedia System at the time such Booking occurred, including Bookings with stay-

dates occurring after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. You agree to update the Rates, Property

Fees, Taxes and other amounts entered into the Expedia Interface (or the information entered by each Participating

Property necessary for Expedia to derive them) as necessary and in accordance with this Agreement. You agree

that Your Rates and Property Fees will not unlawfully increase in reaction to the occurrence or threatened

occurrence of a Force Majeure Event. You accept that you will not require guests to pay any fees or surcharges

relating to their payment process or method (e.g., guests will not be charged any fees or surcharges for credit or

debit card payments), unless such fees or surcharges are specifically allowed by local law and notified to Expedia.

c. Merchandising; Intellectual Property. You grant Expedia and each of its Affiliates the worldwide, nonexclusive,

royalty-free, fully paid right and license, in any and all media now known or hereafter discovered or developed, to

use, reproduce, distribute, display, and prepare derivative works from the Property Information for purposes of

identifying, promoting, merchandising and/or obtaining Bookings for the Participating Properties. In addition, You

agree to provide Expedia Property Information through the Expedia Interface or as otherwise requested by Expedia.

You represent and warrant that You are the owner or authorized licensee of all of the Property Information and

that such content, and Expedia’s and any of its Affiliates’ use, reproduction, distribution and display of such content,

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 6 of 14

Contract 269 ROW EC PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



does not and will not violate the rights of any third party. To the extent Your consent is required for Expedia to

utilize the right and license above, You represent that You have all necessary rights and provide Your consent and

agree that Your consent may be shared directly with third parties. You shall not submit Property Information to

Expedia that is subject to limitations on term, type or nature of use, unless Expedia agrees to accept such Property

Information and provided that You agree to inform Expedia when such use is no longer permitted. Any additional

advertising or marketing to be performed for You shall be governed by Expedia’s then-standard marketing terms

and conditions. Expedia may remove any Property Information, or edit any Property Information that Expedia

believes to be inaccurate or inappropriate. This Agreement does not grant You any ownership interest in, or any

express or implied license or right to, any of the Materials or to any software or intellectual property rights owned

by or licensed to Expedia or any of its Affiliates. The Property Information You provide to Expedia under this

Agreement will be equal to or better than what You make available through Your own or any third-party booking

or distribution channels.

d. Classification Ratings. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, You agree that (i) Expedia will make the final

determination of any Expedia star class or equivalent classification rating assigned to a Participating Property, if

any, and (ii) an Expedia star class or equivalent classification rating assigned to a Participating Property may be

changed by Expedia from time to time in its sole discretion. To the extent any Participating Property has an officially

mandated star class or equivalent classification rating, You agree to provide such rating, and its source, to Expedia.

e. Display; Special Programs and Discounts. Participating Properties displayed on the Expedia System will appear

in an order determined by Expedia in its sole discretion. Further details can be found on the Expedia Group lodging

partner resource website. You agree Expedia and/or certain of its Affiliates may also on occasion offer discount

pricing for Participating Properties; provided, that (i) any such offers shall be available with respect to a broad

number of properties and not limited to a single Participating Property and (ii) to the extent You and Expedia have

not agreed otherwise with respect to any particular offer, any such discount will be funded by a reduction to the

Compensation otherwise retained by Expedia. At Your request and upon reasonable notice, Expedia will meet with

You to discuss any such offers and Your participation in them. You acknowledge and agree that benefits offered to

guests by Expedia and any of its Affiliates through their respective loyalty programs or through customer service

coupons shall not be a violation of this Agreement.



5\. Operational Matters.

a. Booking Process. Expedia will provide You notice of each Booking processed through the Expedia System. You

will provide Expedia confirmation of receipt of every Booking notification within forty-eight (48) hours of Expedia’s

notification being delivered to You. You must honor every Booking for which You receive a Booking notification.

b. Anti-Fraud Cooperation. You acknowledge that You are solely responsible for ensuring that the identification

presented by any guest is valid and matches the Booking information provided to You by Expedia. If the relevant

Participating Property does not have a front desk or other means to physically verify guest identification, You may

use other commercially reasonable methods to comply with Your obligations in the previous sentence, provided

that, any such alternative method shall comply with the requirements of Section C.5.c. of this Agreement. If a

Party believes a Booking may be or is fraudulent, or certain data provided by a guest cannot be verified, then the

Parties will work together in good faith to address such fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Booking. In the event

of a fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Booking, Expedia may cancel such Booking at any time. If cancellation of

a fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Expedia Collect Booking, Package Booking or Opaque Booking occurs prior to

or within two (2) hours after check-in, neither Expedia nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to pay any

cancellation fee or penalty. If the cancellation of a fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Expedia Collect Booking,

Package Booking or Opaque Booking occurs after such two (2) hour period following check-in, the maximum penalty

that may be charged to Expedia will be the relevant EC Remittance or Package Remittance for the Participating

Property, up to and including the date the Expedia Collect Booking, Package Booking or Opaque Booking was

cancelled, plus any applicable Taxes. If, as a result of an investigation into a fraudulent Booking, Expedia

recommends fraud prevention actions to You, You agree that You will implement such recommendations within a

reasonable timeframe.

c. Personal Data and Security. Each Party agrees that it has in place and will maintain, or will establish and

maintain, adequate security procedures and controls to prevent the unintended disclosure of, and the unauthorized

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 7 of 14

Contract 269 ROW EC PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



access to or misappropriation of, any personal data or information of any guest. Each Party agrees that it will

process, store, transmit and access any guest information in compliance with applicable law and, for guest

information that includes payment information (including, without limitation, credit card, debit card, or financial

account information), will do so in compliance with the current Payment Card Information Data Security Standard

as issued by the PCI Security Standard Council, as updated from time to time. Unless You receive consent directly

from the guest, You and Your affiliates will not directly or indirectly, engage in any solicited or unsolicited marketing,

promotional, or similar communications, with any guest that has booked a Property through the Expedia System.

d. Health and Safety. At Expedia’s request, You agree to promptly provide Expedia with copies of each

Participating Property’s operating licenses and/or similar certificates, if any, indicating the relevant Participating

Property’s compliance with the health and safety obligations, if any, required for the relevant Participating

Properties to operate legally in the jurisdictions in which such Participating Properties operate. In addition, Expedia

may provide You with a health and safety self-assessment questionnaire from time to time for some or all of the

Participating Properties, and You agree to supply the information requested in the self-assessment in a timely

manner. Further, You agree to permit any employee of or consultant appointed by Expedia to carry out health and

safety reviews of any of the Participating Properties. If, as a result of a self-assessment or a health and safety

review, Expedia recommends health and safety enhancements or changes for any Property, You agree that You will

implement such recommendations within a timeframe to be mutually agreed upon by You and Expedia. In the

event that You fail to comply with Your obligations under this Section C.5.d, Expedia may terminate this Agreement

immediately with respect to specific Participating Properties or all Participating Properties, as applicable, upon

written notice to You.

e. Taxes. (i) Each Property acknowledges that it is solely responsible for the accuracy of Tax rate information, the

identification of applicable Taxes and any changes to the Tax rates entered into the Expedia Interface. You are

responsible for accounting to the applicable governmental authority for any Taxes applicable to any amounts

received by You with respect to any Bookings and/or in consideration for the services that You provide. Upon

request, You will provide documentation to substantiate Your registration with and/or remittance of Taxes to any

applicable governmental authority or to provide such other information or documentation as Expedia requests to

comply with its Tax obligations. Property Manager acknowledges that the Tax information entered into the Expedia

Interface is based on the Rate Property Manager provides to Expedia to facilitate a Booking. (ii) The Compensation

is exclusive of any sales, value-added, turnover, withholding or other transaction-based Tax , and where such Tax

applies, it will be retained by Expedia. The Compensation shall be paid to Expedia in cleared funds, without any

deduction or set-off, and exclusive of and without any deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes, or withholdings

of any kind. In the event that You are required to make such a deduction or withholding, You agree that the

Compensation will not be less than the Compensation that Expedia would have received had no deduction or

withholding been required. (iii) If requested by Expedia, You will promptly provide Expedia with valid Tax invoices

in respect of any transactions entered into under this Agreement, where Taxes are chargeable under applicable

law. (iv) Property Manager shall deliver to Expedia, prior to receipt of any payment hereunder, a duly completed

and signed copy of IRS Form W-9, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor thereto) to establish

that it is not subject to withholding or is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax, as

applicable. Where Property Manager delivers to Expedia IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor

thereto), Property Manager acknowledges that it is the beneficial owner of all payments from Expedia to it under

this Agreement for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Property Manager shall (A) promptly notify Expedia of any

change in circumstances that impacts the validity of the information previously provided, including that which

would cause Property Manager to be subject to withholding or modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or

reduction of withholding tax, and (B) take any action that may be necessary to avoid any requirement that Expedia

make any deduction or withholding for Taxes from amounts payable to Property Manager. Property Manager shall

provide Expedia with an updated version of IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor thereto)

every three years. If Property Manager fails to perform any of its obligations under this Section C.5.e, then Expedia

shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment to the relevant Property such amounts as Expedia is

required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. All amounts withheld by Expedia pursuant to this Section

C.5.e shall be treated as paid to the relevant Property for purposes of Section A.3.

a. Confidentiality and Public Statements. The Parties agree that any confidential, proprietary, know-how or trade

secret information of any Party in any form that is designated as “confidential” or that a reasonable person knows

or reasonably should understand to be confidential (“Confidential Information”) will only be used for the purposes

of this Agreement. Without the express written consent of the Party whose Confidential Information will be

disclosed, during and after the Term, no Party will disclose or allow the disclosure of any Confidential Information

of another Party to any third party. Entities directly or indirectly controlled by Expedia, Inc. shall not be considered

third parties for the purpose of this Section C.6.a. Each Party may disclose Confidential Information to its

employees, directors, officers, agents, independent contractors and consultants (or to those of entities described

in the previous sentence) on a need-to-know basis, provided that the receiving Party shall ensure that such persons

are aware of and, shall require compliance with all the provisions of this Section C.6.a. For the avoidance of doubt,

“Confidential Information” includes, but is not limited to, information (i) provided by a guest in connection with

any Booking, or (ii) provided by Expedia or any of its Affiliates, or otherwise obtained by You, in connection with

this Agreement, including without limitation, the terms and conditions of this Agreement. “Confidential

Information” does not include any information that (A) becomes publicly available without the receiving Party’s

breach of any obligation owed to the disclosing Party, (B) was known to the receiving Party prior to the disclosing

Party’s disclosure of such information, (C) became known to the receiving Party from a source other than the

disclosing Party where such source did not breach an obligation of confidentiality owed to the disclosing Party, or

(D) is independently developed by the receiving Party. A Party may disclose another Party’s Confidential

Information if required to do so to comply with a court order or other government demand; provided, that prior to

disclosure, You must seek the highest level of protection available and provide Expedia with reasonable advance

notice. All Confidential Information will remain the exclusive property of the disclosing Party. No Party shall issue

or participate in any press release or other public announcement, confirmation or statement regarding this

Agreement or the contents of this Agreement without the other Party’s prior written consent.

satisfactory to the Parties, You will not (i) apply any payment received for any other Booking or invoice to the

disputed Booking or invoice, (ii) charge or attempt to charge a guest directly for a disputed amount, (iii) refuse to

honor any guest’s Booking, or (iv) take any other action likely to interfere with the fulfillment or enjoyment of any

must be done in compliance with the requirements of Section C.5.c above, as applicable.

c. Books and Records. Subject to the terms of this Section C.6.c, Expedia’s books and records with respect to this

receipt of Bookings made by guests through the Expedia System and the amount of the applicable Compensation,

acknowledge that Expedia generally has no knowledge of (i) guests’ actual arrival or departure dates, (ii) any

cancellation notice that may be given by guests directly to You, or whether any such cancellation notice as may be

given is sufficient under Your relevant policies to relieve guests (and Expedia) of all or any portion of the charges

otherwise due to You, or (iii) any adjustment that may be negotiated by You directly with guests with respect to

reductions in rate, duration of stay, or otherwise. Accordingly, You agree that Expedia and its Affiliates shall be

entitled to rely upon and accept as accurate any information relating to Bookings received by Expedia from You.

d. Limitations. (i) Except as expressly described in this Agreement, no Party makes any warranties of any kind,

whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and each Party specifically disclaims all implied warranties,

including any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted

by applicable law. (ii) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude either Party’s liability for fraud, death or

personal injury caused by negligence, any other liability which cannot be limited by law, or any liability it has under

an express obligation in this Agreement to indemnify the other Party. (iii) Expedia may, at any time for any reason

(including no reason), elect not to offer, display, or list for booking any Participating Property made available by

or other laws that require the relevant Participating Properties to be covered by liability or other types of insurance,

with all such applicable laws. To the extent that Participating Properties are located in jurisdictions without legally-

mandated insurance requirements to operate legally, You represent and warrant that each relevant Participating

Property is covered by liability insurance coverage in an amount that is consistent with best industry practice. For

the avoidance of doubt, such liability insurance coverage must not exclude business activities and/or the renting,

arranging or recommending of any accommodations by or for others. To the extent permitted by law, You will

either (i) name Expedia as an additional insured on such liability insurance policies, and, deliver to Expedia

certificates of insurance that verify compliance with the preceding clause or (ii) provide other evidence of insurance

or additional terms and conditions, You may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Expedia. Your failure

reasonable efforts to cooperate with such requests and to comply with all applicable laws. In the event that You

fail to comply with any applicable laws, Expedia may terminate this Agreement immediately with respect to specific

terms relating to Expedia’s relationship with other properties, and that Expedia does not have any duty to disclose

is not intended to and does not create a partnership or joint venture relationship between or among the Parties. A

under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Expedia, in the case of Properties, or Property Manager,

in the case of Expedia; provided, however, that Expedia may assign any of its rights or obligations to any of its

Affiliates. Any purported assignment in contravention of the preceding sentence will be void and of no force or

effect. This Agreement is binding upon, and inures to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective permitted

successors and assigns. Only a Party to this Agreement, which includes such Party’s successors and permitted

assigns, shall have any right to enforce any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No provision in this

Agreement may be waived, unless such waiver is confirmed in writing and signed by Expedia and Property Manager.

If any part of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the

remainder of this Agreement continues in effect. The language of this Agreement will be English and any translation

of this Agreement into a language other than English will be for reference purposes only. In the event of a conflict

of interpretation, the English language will prevail. Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties, all payments

contemplated under this Agreement will be made in a currency selected by Expedia. Sections A.1-A.3, B.1-B.3,

TERMS AND CONDITIONS



A. PROPERTY COLLECT BOOKINGS



1. Compensation. For each night covered by a Property Collect Booking, Expedia will be entitled to

compensation (the “Compensation”) equal to the Compensation Percentage of the Reservation Price and Property

Fees. The Parties agree that the Compensation may be increased at Your discretion.



2. Property Collect Bookings. For each Property Collect Booking, You permit bookings by guests with the

relevant Participating Property through the Expedia System, with You acting on behalf of the relevant Participating

Property and in Your own name, but Expedia will not collect any advance payments from guests at the time of such

booking. You acknowledge that You will be responsible for collecting the relevant Reservation Price, Taxes,

Property Fees and any other amounts or charges (to the extent, if any, not included in the Reservation Price but

due and payable from guests as described in the Expedia Interface) directly from guests at the time of check-out

unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. For each Property Collect Booking, You will pay to Expedia the relevant

Compensation in the manner described in Section A.4. It should be noted that the Expedia Interface and/or other

Expedia resources may refer to “Hotel Collect” and not contain any references to Property Collect. In such

instances, references to “Hotel Collect” should generally be understood to refer to Property Collect and the

applicable terms of this Agreement, as applicable.



3. Fenced Bookings. You agree that for each Rate Plan for Property Collect Bookings You provide, Expedia

will create on Your behalf (or You will create) a Rate Plan for Fenced Bookings. Each Fenced Booking Rate Plan will

be the Rate Plan applicable to the corresponding Property Collect Booking reduced by the Fenced Booking

Percentage. The Parties agree that the Fenced Booking Percentage may be increased at Your discretion. For each

reserved night covered by a Fenced Booking, You will be entitled to an amount equal to the Fenced Booking

Reservation Price reduced by the Compensation, plus Taxes (except for Taxes that Expedia pays, or will pay, directly

to the applicable Tax authority) paid by the guest. You may enforce black-out dates or other availability restrictions

on Rates or Rate Plans for Fenced Bookings based on Your revenue management strategy in the manner provided

through the Expedia Interface, so long as these availability restrictions are properly communicated to Expedia in

advance. You may discontinue participation in Fenced Bookings by opting out in the manner provided through the

Expedia Interface.



4. Payments for Bookings. Expedia will submit invoices for Bookings to You through Expedia’s then-current

invoicing system. You agree that payment for all invoices for Bookings shall be due upon receipt using one of the

payment options available to You in the Expedia Interface. If you are unable to access the Expedia Interface, Your

payment method will be determined by Expedia and communicated to You. You agree not to use a third party to

process payments for Bookings on Your behalf without Expedia’s consent and Expedia may implement a fee in

respect of any such use of a third party payment processor. You agree that if your payment method results in

Expedia incurring bank fees or other similar charges, You will reimburse Expedia for such bank fees or similar

charges. Payments not made within fifteen (15) days of the date of the invoice may be subject to late charges equal

to 2%, or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is lower, of the outstanding balance for each month

(or portion thereof) the payment is overdue. Unless You notify Expedia of a no-show or cancellation of a Booking,

or a change to a Booking, in the manner and within the time period set forth in the Expedia Interface, as the same

may be updated by Expedia from time to time, Expedia shall be entitled to, and shall invoice You for, Compensation

on the entire length of stay of such Booking as booked through the Expedia System. Expedia also may contact

guests to confirm the accuracy of any documentation submitted by You in connection with any such notice. Expedia

reserves the right to make changes or updates to its invoicing system, payment methods and/or invoicing

requirements at any time.



5. No Additional Expenditures. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the amounts received by Expedia

under this Agreement adequately cover the services Expedia has agreed to provide in accordance with this

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 3 of 14

Contract 271 ROW PC PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



Agreement. The Parties further acknowledge that Expedia will not incur any exceptional and/or additional

expenditure relating to any of Your Bookings without Your prior agreement to reimburse Expedia fully for any such

exceptional and/or additional expenditure.

B. GENERAL TERMS



1. Term. The term of this Agreement begins on the Effective Date and will remain in effect unless

terminated by either You or Expedia as provided in the Agreement.



2. Rates and Availability.

a. Availability. The Parties agree that Expedia will be permitted to make Participating Properties available for

booking in its discretion as Property Collect Bookings and/or Fenced Bookings.

b. Rates. You agree that the Rates and Rate Plans You provide to Expedia will be equal to or better than those

made available through Your own or any third-party booking or distribution channels, except in respect of

Designated Country Properties, if applicable, with respect to which the Rate Plans Properties provide to Expedia

for booking by guests through the Expedia System will be equal to or better than those made available through

Properties’ own Online Public booking or distribution channels. Any rules, restrictions, policies, and/or conditions

(including rules associated with cancellation) applicable to any Rate You make available through the Expedia System

shall be no more restrictive than those applicable to any comparable rate that You make available through Your

own or any third-party booking or distribution channels, except in respect of Designated Country Properties, if

applicable, with respect to which such rules, restrictions, policies and/or conditions shall be no more restrictive

than those applicable to any comparable accomodation that the relevant Property makes available through

Properties’ own Online Public booking or distribution channels. Providing Expedia with competitive rates, rules,

restrictions, policies and conditions is part of a fair and balanced commercial bargain between you and Expedia,

one which delivers incremental bookings to you on attractive terms (including importantly at no upfront costs), and

one which allows Expedia to provide a comprehensive search and booking service to guests, while protecting

Expedia from free-riding on its considerable investments in attracting guests to the Participating Properties.

Subject to Sections A.3, B.4.b and B.4.e, and unless otherwise agreed, You instruct Expedia not to display Property

Collect Bookings with a Reservation Price lower than the relevant Best Available Rate or, in the case of Fenced

Bookings, not to display with a Reservation Price lower than the relevant Best Available Rate reduced by the Fenced

Booking Percentage.



3\. Guest Experience.

a. Guest Experience. You acknowledge that You will not treat any guest that books through the Expedia

System differently than You treat any other guest that books through Your own or any third-party booking or

distribution channels, including, without limitation, with respect to the handling of overbooking situations, the

provision of customer service and, except in respect of Designated Country Properties, if applicable, the amenities

available or the amount and charging of Property Fees. Designated Country Properties shall not treat any guest

that books through the Expedia System differently than it treats any other guest that books through Properties’

own Online Public booking or distribution channels in respect of amenities available or the amount and charging of

Property Fees and/or credit or debit card fees or surcharges to the extent that such fees or surcharges are permitted

pursuant to Section B.4.b.

b. Cancellation; No Shows; Regulatory Cancellations. You agree that Your cancellation and no-show policies

offered through the Expedia System will (i) be at least as favorable as any cancellation or no show policies offered

by You through Your own Online Public or any third-party booking or distribution channels and (ii) comply with

applicable laws, if any, in the jurisdictions where the relevant Participating Properties are located. Subject to the

terms and conditions of Your relevant cancellation policy, Expedia reserves the right to cancel a Booking at any

time. Except as may be made available to You in the Expedia Interface, You shall not cancel any Booking and shall

not encourage guests to cancel Bookings. If You have not entered Your cancellation policies into the Expedia

Interface, Expedia’s default cancellation policy will apply. Expedia is entitled to the Compensation Percentage of

any penalty amounts charged to guests for no-shows, cancellations or similar booking modifications. If Expedia

cancels all or part of a Booking to comply with applicable Short Term Rental Laws or any other applicable laws, You

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 4 of 14

Contract 271 ROW PC PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



agree to (i) waive any and all terms and conditions of Your relevant cancellation policy and (ii) reimburse Expedia

for all expenses (including any Taxes) incurred by Expedia in securing alternative arrangements for the affected

guest, including applicable charges at the alternative property and associated guest relocation costs.

c. Relocations. If You are, or reasonably believe that You will be, unable to honor a Booking, You agree that

You will immediately (i) notify Expedia of such inability, (ii) relocate the affected guest to a comparable property

(i.e. within the original booking area, with sleeping accommodations for the same or a greater number of guests,

the same or a greater number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and with similar amenities) and with the same star

class or equivalent classification rating, if applicable, (iii) pre-pay or make other arrangements to cover the charges

at such property for the nights in question and all transportation and associated relocation costs to such property,

and (iv) waive any additional fees or other payments that would otherwise be payable to You by Expedia or the

guest as a result of the Booking. Expedia reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to perform items (ii) and/or (iii)

above directly, in which case You agree to reimburse Expedia for all expenses (including any Taxes) incurred by

Expedia in securing such alternative arrangements, including applicable charges at the alternative property and

associated guest relocation costs.

d. Complaints. You agree to respond to any guest complaints relating Your Property in a prompt and

reasonable manner. If a guest cancels all or part of a Booking as a result of dissatisfaction with Your

accommodations or services, Expedia may refund some or all of the amounts paid by such guest for such Booking,

and You will reimburse Expedia for any such refunded amounts within thirty (30) days of receipt of written request

for reimbursement.



4\. Loading and Display of Rates and Information.

a. Participating Property Information and Expedia Interface; Merchant Payment Information; Performance

by Participating Properties. You agree to use the Expedia Interface to enter or modify all relevant information

relating to each Participating Property’s Rates, availability, applicable Tax rates, Property Fees, Property

Information, cancellation and no show policies, Facility Policies, and/or to provide or modify the relevant account

information and preferred payment and notice practices. You acknowledge and agree that Facility Policies shall

comply with all applicable laws and shall not significantly limit a guest’s reasonable use and enjoyment of the

relevant Participating Property. Expedia may restrict or condition the use of Facility Policies at any time and/or

require that specific information related to Facility Policies be entered into the Expedia Interface (or otherwise

provided by You to Expedia in a manner acceptable to Expedia). Expedia may terminate this Agreement in

accordance with Section B.6.l. with respect to specific Participating Properties or Property Manager, as applicable,

if Expedia determines, in its sole discretion, that the applicable Facility Policies do not comply with the requirements

set forth in this Section B.4.a. You acknowledge that You are responsible for the accuracy of all facts and

information You provide to Expedia regarding the Participating Properties. In no event shall Expedia be liable for

the content of information provided by You to Expedia. You agree to advise Expedia immediately if any such

information is incomplete or inaccurate. You must also advise Expedia immediately if, for any reason, any

Participating Property is no longer, or facts arise that will or may cause any Participating Property not to be

managed by or otherwise represented by You for purposes of this Agreement. During the Term, you will have access

to information provided or generated by you and information relating to the Properties collected or generated by

Expedia to the extent that this information is generally available in the Expedia Interface. The Expedia Interface

privacy policy (currently located at https://welcome.expediagroup.com/en/privacy-policy) will apply to Expedia’s

storage and use of this information. You will submit to Expedia a fully-completed Merchant Payment Information

Form and any additional information required by any future updates to such form for each Property. In the event

of a change of Property ownership that terminates Your right to represent or legally bind the relevant Property or

requires any change to the information included in the Merchant Payment Information Form and/or the Expedia

Interface relating to the relevant Participating Property, You will (i) update such information through the Expedia

Interface and/or by submitting an updated Merchant Payment Information Form, as applicable, or if You are unable

to update such information through the Expedia Interface, (ii) You will provide fifteen (15) days written notice to

Expedia of such change, which notice shall be sent in accordance with the provisions included in Section B.6.i of

this Agreement. You shall cause each Property to agree to become a Participating Property under this Agreement.

You acknowledge and agree that You shall take all actions needed to ensure each Participating Property’s proper

and prompt performance of the terms and conditions set forth herein, including without limitation prompt

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 5 of 14

Contract 271 ROW PC PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



enforcement of any and all contracts or arrangements pursuant to which You are authorized to instruct Expedia to

make Participating Properties available under this Agreement. In the event a Participating Property fails to perform

any obligation under this Agreement, Property Manager shall be responsible for such non-performance and shall

take whatever actions may be necessary to promptly cure any such non-performance.

b. Rate Information. You acknowledge that You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the information

that You enter into the Expedia Interface. You authorize Expedia to ascertain in accordance with this Agreement,

the

Rates (as well as the Reservation Prices), together with any Property Fees or other amounts payable, based on

information entered by You through the Expedia Interface (or otherwise provided by You to Expedia in a manner

acceptable to Expedia). Any action by Expedia to derive Rates, Property Fees, Taxes or other amounts on Your

behalf shall be deemed to be Your action, for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You

acknowledge that You will immediately notify Expedia if You believe that Expedia has incorrectly derived any Rates,

Reservation Prices, Property Fees, Taxes or other amounts relating to any Property. You agree to honor all Bookings

made during the Term at the Rate in the Expedia Interface and at the Reservation Price (together with any Property

Fees and/or Taxes) shown on the Expedia System at the time such Booking occurred, including Bookings with stay-

dates occurring after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. You agree to update the Rates, Property

Fees, Taxes and other amounts entered into the Expedia Interface (or the information entered by each Participating

Property necessary for Expedia to derive them) as necessary and in accordance with this Agreement. You agree

that Your Rates and Property Fees will not unlawfully increase in reaction to the occurrence or threatened

occurrence of a Force Majeure Event. You accept that you will not require guests to pay any fees or surcharges

relating to their payment process or method (e.g., guests will not be charged any fees or surcharges for credit or

debit card payments), unless such fees or surcharges are specifically allowed by local law and notified to Expedia.

c. Merchandising; Intellectual Property. You grant Expedia and each of its Affiliates the worldwide,

nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license, in any and all media now known or hereafter discovered or

developed, to use, reproduce, distribute, display, and prepare derivative works from the Property Information for

purposes of identifying, promoting, merchandising and/or obtaining Bookings for the Participating Properties. In

addition, You agree to provide Expedia Property Information through the Expedia Interface or as otherwise

requested by Expedia. You represent and warrant that You are the owner or authorized licensee of all of the

Property Information and that such content, and Expedia’s and any of its Affiliates’ use, reproduction, distribution

and display of such content, does not and will not violate the rights of any third party. To the extent Your consent

is required for Expedia to utilize the right and license above, You represent that You have all necessary rights and

provide Your consent and agree that Your consent may be shared directly with third parties. You shall not submit

Property Information to Expedia that is subject to limitations on term, type or nature of use, unless Expedia agrees

to accept such Property Information and provided that You agree to inform Expedia when such use is no longer

permitted. Any additional advertising or marketing to be performed for You shall be governed by Expedia’s then-

standard marketing terms and conditions. Expedia may remove any Property Information, or edit any Property

Information that Expedia believes to be inaccurate or inappropriate. This Agreement does not grant You any

ownership interest in, or any express or implied license or right to, any of the Materials or to any software or

intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to Expedia or any of its Affiliates. The Property Information You

provide to Expedia under this Agreement will be equal to or better than what You make available through Your

own or any third-party booking or distribution channels.

d. Classification Ratings. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, You agree that (i) Expedia will make the

final determination of any Expedia star class or equivalent classification rating assigned to a Participating Property,

if any, and (ii) an Expedia star class or equivalent classification rating assigned to a Participating Property may be

changed by Expedia from time to time in its sole discretion. To the extent any Participating Property has an officially

mandated star class or equivalent classification rating, You agree to provide such rating, and its source, to Expedia.

e. Display; Special Programs and Discounts. Participating Properties displayed on the Expedia System will

appear in an order determined by Expedia in its sole discretion. Further details can be found on the Expedia Group

lodging partner resource website. You agree Expedia and/or certain of its Affiliates may also on occasion offer

discount pricing for Participating Properties; provided, that (i) any such offers shall be available with respect to a

broad number of properties and not limited to a single Participating Property and (ii) to the extent You and Expedia

have not agreed otherwise with respect to any particular offer, any such discount will be funded by a reduction to

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 6 of 14

Contract 271 ROW PC PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



the Compensation otherwise payable by You to Expedia or retained by Expedia. At Your request and upon

reasonable notice, Expedia will meet with You to discuss any such offers and Your participation in them. You

acknowledge and agree that benefits offered to guests by Expedia and any of its Affiliates through their respective

loyalty programs or through customer service coupons shall not be a violation of this Agreement.



5\. Operational Matters.

a. Booking Process. Expedia will provide You notice of each Booking processed through the Expedia System.

You will provide Expedia confirmation of receipt of every Booking notification within forty-eight (48) hours of

Expedia’s notification being delivered to You. You must honor every Booking for which You receive a Booking

notification.

b. Anti-Fraud Cooperation. You acknowledge that You are solely responsible for ensuring that the

identification presented by any guest is valid and matches the Booking information provided to You by Expedia. If

the relevant Participating Property does not have a front desk or other means to physically verify guest

identification, You may use other commercially reasonable methods to comply with Your obligations in the previous

sentence, provided that, any such alternative method shall comply with the requirements of Section B.5.c. of this

Agreement. If a Party believes a Booking may be or is fraudulent, or certain data provided by a guest cannot be

verified, then the Parties will work together in good faith to address such fraudulent or potentially fraudulent

Booking. In the event of a fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Booking, Expedia may cancel such Booking at any

time. You acknowledge that neither Expedia nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability to You in connection

with any fraudulent or potentially fraudulent Booking. If, as a result of an investigation into a fraudulent Booking,

Expedia recommends fraud prevention actions to You, You agree that You will implement such recommendations

within a reasonable timeframe.

c. Personal Data and Security. (i) Each Party agrees that it has in place and will maintain, or will establish and

maintain, adequate security procedures and controls to prevent the unintended disclosure of, and the

unauthorized access to or misappropriation of, any personal data or information of any guest. Each Party agrees

that it will process, store, transmit and access any guest information in compliance with applicable law and, for

guest information that includes payment information (including, without limitation, credit card, debit card, or

financial account information), will do so in compliance with the current Payment Card Information Data Security

Standard (“PCI DSS”). Unless You receive consent directly from the guest, You and Your affiliates will not directly

or indirectly, engage in any solicited or unsolicited marketing, promotional, or similar communications, with any

guest that has booked a Property through the Expedia System. (ii) This Section B.5.c.ii applies to circumstances

where You are responsible for charging and/or collecting payment from the guest for such Booking and Expedia

possesses, stores, processes, or transmits guests’ cardholder data on Your behalf, or to the extent that Expedia

could impact the security of Your cardholder data environment: Expedia acknowledges that Expedia is responsible

for the security of cardholder data that Expedia possesses, stores, processes or transmits and will comply with the

PCI DSS as issued by the PCI Security Standard Council, as updated from time to time.

d. Health and Safety. At Expedia’s request, You agree to promptly provide Expedia with copies of each

Participating Property’s operating licenses and/or similar certificates, if any, indicating the relevant Participating

Property’s compliance with the health and safety obligations, if any, required for the relevant Participating

Properties to operate legally in the jurisdictions in which such Participating Properties operate. In addition, Expedia

may provide You with a health and safety self-assessment questionnaire from time to time for some or all of the

Participating Properties, and You agree to supply the information requested in the self-assessment in a timely

manner. Further, You agree to permit any employee of or consultant appointed by Expedia to carry out health and

safety reviews of any of the Participating Properties. If, as a result of a self-assessment or a health and safety

review, Expedia recommends health and safety enhancements or changes for any Property, You agree that You will

implement such recommendations within a timeframe to be mutually agreed upon by You and Expedia. In the

event that You fail to comply with Your obligations under this Section B.5.d, Expedia may terminate this Agreement

immediately with respect to specific Participating Properties or all Participating Properties, as applicable, upon

written notice to You.

e. Taxes. (i) Each Property acknowledges that it is solely responsible for the accuracy of Tax rate information,

the identification of applicable Taxes and any changes to the Tax rates entered into the Expedia Interface. You are

responsible for accounting to the applicable governmental authority for any Taxes applicable to any amounts

CONFIDENTIAL



Page 7 of 14

Contract 271 ROW PC PM AGREEMENT \& T\&Cs (010218)



received by You with respect to any Bookings and/or in consideration for the services that You provide. Upon

request, You will provide documentation to substantiate Your registration with and/or remittance of Taxes to any

applicable governmental authority or to provide such other information or documentation as Expedia requests to

comply with its Tax obligations. Property Manager acknowledges that the Tax information entered into the Expedia

Interface is based on the Rate Property Manager provides to Expedia to facilitate a Booking. (ii) The Compensation

is exclusive of any sales, value-added, turnover, withholding or other transaction-based Tax, and where such Tax

applies, You shall pay the Compensation to Expedia in cleared funds, without any deduction or set-off, and exclusive

of and without any deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes, or withholdings of any kind. In the event that You

are required to make such a deduction or withholding, You agree that the Compensation will not be less than the

Compensation that Expedia would have received had no deduction or withholding been required. (iii) If requested

by Expedia, You will promptly provide Expedia with valid Tax invoices in respect of any transactions entered into

under this Agreement, where Taxes are chargeable under applicable law. (iv) Property Manager shall deliver to

Expedia, prior to receipt of any payment hereunder, a duly completed and signed copy of IRS Form W-9, IRS Form

W-8BEN-E, or IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor thereto) to establish that it is not subject to withholding or is

entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax, as applicable. Where Property Manager delivers

to Expedia IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor thereto),

Property Manager acknowledges that it is the beneficial owner of all payments from Expedia to it under this

Agreement for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Property Manager shall (A) promptly notify Expedia of any change

in circumstances that impacts the validity of the information previously provided, including that which would cause

Property Manager to be subject to withholding or modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction of

withholding tax, and (B) take any action that may be necessary to avoid any requirement that Expedia make any

deduction or withholding for Taxes from amounts payable to Property Manager. Property Manager shall provide

Expedia with an updated version of IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor thereto) every three

years. If Property Manager fails to perform any of its obligations under this Section B.5.e, then Expedia shall be

entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment to the relevant Property such amounts as Expedia is required

to deduct and withhold under applicable law. All amounts withheld by Expedia pursuant to this Section B.5.e shall

be treated as paid to the relevant Property for purposes of Section A.4.



6\. Miscellaneous.

a. Confidentiality and Public Statements. The Parties agree that any confidential, proprietary, know-how or

trade secret information of any Party in any form that is designated as “confidential” or that a reasonable person

knows or reasonably should understand to be confidential (“Confidential Information”) will only be used for the

purposes of this Agreement. Without the express written consent of the Party whose Confidential Information will

be disclosed, during and after the Term, no Party will disclose or allow the disclosure of any Confidential

Information of another Party to any third party. Entities directly or indirectly controlled by Expedia, Inc. shall not

be considered third parties for the purpose of this Section B.6.a. Each Party may disclose Confidential Information

to its employees, directors, officers, agents, independent contractors and consultants (or to those of entities

described in the previous sentence) on a need-to-know basis, provided that the receiving Party shall ensure that

such persons are aware of and, shall require compliance with all the provisions of this Section B.6.a. For the

avoidance of doubt, “Confidential Information” includes, but is not limited to, information (i) provided by a guest

in connection with any Booking, or (ii) provided by Expedia or any of its Affiliates, or otherwise obtained by You, in

connection with this Agreement, including without limitation, the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

“Confidential Information” does not include any information that (A) becomes publicly available without the

receiving Party’s breach of any obligation owed to the disclosing Party, (B) was known to the receiving Party prior

to the disclosing Party’s disclosure of such information, (C) became known to the receiving Party from a source

other than the disclosing Party where such source did not breach an obligation of confidentiality owed to the

disclosing Party, or (D) is independently developed by the receiving Party. A Party may disclose another Party’s

Confidential Information if required to do so to comply with a court order or other government demand; provided,

that prior to disclosure, You must seek the highest level of protection available and provide Expedia with reasonable

advance notice. All Confidential Information will remain the exclusive property of the disclosing Party. No Party

shall issue or participate in any press release or other public announcement, confirmation or statement regarding

this Agreement or the contents of this Agreement without the other Party’s prior written consent.

CONFIDENTIAL

b. Disputes; Other Charges. If a dispute arises under this Agreement (including any dispute regarding

termination or suspension), the disputing party will promptly provide written notice with reasonable detail

regarding the dispute. Upon receipt of a dispute notice, the parties will work together in good faith to resolve the

matter within a reasonable time period. If you are located in the European Union, the disputing party may refer

the matter to mediation through Expedia Lodging Mediation Program. Until the dispute has been resolved in a

manner satisfactory to the Parties, You will not (i) apply any payment received for any other Booking or invoice to

the disputed Booking or invoice, (ii) charge or attempt to charge a guest directly for a disputed amount, (iii) refuse

to honor any guest’s Booking, or (iv) take any other action likely to interfere with the fulfillment or enjoyment of

any guest’s Booking. You are responsible for any changes or services requested by a guest directly from You and

You are solely responsible for collecting from the guest any charges for such changes or services and such collection

must be done in compliance with the requirements of Section B.5.c above, as applicable.

c. Books and Records. Subject to the terms of this Section B.6.c, Expedia’s books and records with respect to

this Agreement, including without limitation, any information contained in the Expedia Interface or the Expedia

System, or in any facsimile or electronic communication submitted by You or Expedia, will constitute evidence of

Your receipt of Bookings made by guests through the Expedia System and the amount of the applicable

Compensation in respect of such Bookings. Furthermore, You acknowledge that Expedia generally has no

knowledge of (i) guests’ actual arrival or departure dates, (ii) any cancellation notice that may be given by guests

directly to You, or whether any such cancellation notice as may be given is sufficient under Your relevant policies

to relieve guests (and Expedia) of all or any portion of the charges otherwise due to You, or (iii) any adjustment

that may be negotiated by You directly with guests with respect to reductions in rate, duration of stay, or otherwise.

Accordingly, You agree that Expedia and its Affiliates shall be entitled to rely upon and accept as accurate any

information relating to Bookings received by Expedia from You.

d. Limitations. (i) Except as expressly described in this Agreement, no Party makes any warranties of any kind,

whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and each Party specifically disclaims all implied warranties,

including any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted

by applicable law. (ii) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude either Party’s liability for fraud, death or

personal injury caused by negligence, any other liability which cannot be limited by law, or any liability it has under

an express obligation in this Agreement to indemnify the other Party. (iii) Expedia may, at any time for any reason

(including no reason), elect not to offer, display, or list for booking any Participating Property made available by

You through the Expedia System. (iv) Expedia may change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspects of the Expedia

Interface, including its availability, at any time. (v) Expedia makes no representations or warranties regarding the

Expedia System or any Participating Property, including any temporary or permanent interruption of the operation

of the Expedia System, or with respect to the number, frequency, or type of accomodations booked through the

Expedia System. (vi) With respect to Bookings, nothing in this Agreement constitutes a sale or rental of any

Participating Property to or by Expedia.

e. Representations and Warranties. (i) Each Party represents and warrants that: (A) it is duly organized and

validly existing under the laws of its state of organization and has full entity power and authority to enter into this

Agreement and carry out the provisions included in this Agreement, (B) such Party is authorized to enter into this

Agreement and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and (C) this Agreement constitutes a valid and

Properties, (C) each Participating Property has been provided access to and agrees to be bound by the terms and

relating to the underlying real property of each Participating Property, (E) Each Participating Property’s

performance under this Agreement will comply with the terms of this Agreement, and (F) You hold all licenses,

certificates of insurance that verify compliance with the preceding clause or (ii) provide other evidence of insurance

acceptable to Expedia. You will cause Expedia to receive thirty (30) days’ prior written notice before the

and expenses) directly incurred by Properties’ Indemnitees from that third-party claim or action and to apply only

where such claim or action arose from breach or default by Expedia under this Agreement, including, without

limitation, a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant. Properties agree, at Properties’ expense to

indemnify and defend Expedia, each of its Affiliates and any of Expedia’s or any of its Affiliates’ officers, directors,

employees, or agents (“Expedia’s Indemnitees”) against any third-party claim or action; such indemnity to be

limited to the loss, damage, expense or other liability (including without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses)

directly incurred by Expedia’s Indemnitees from that third-party claim or action and to apply only where such claim

or action arose from or relates to (i) Properties’ accommodations or services, (ii) the performance of Properties’

duties and obligations under this Agreement or any breach or default by Properties under this Agreement,

including, without limitation, a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant, (iii) the inaccuracy of any

information provided by Properties in respect of a Participating Property, or (iv) any allegation that Expedia’s or

any of its Affiliates’ use, reproduction, distribution or display of the Property Information as permitted under this

Agreement infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of any third party. Properties agree to use

counsel reasonably satisfactory to Expedia to defend any indemnified claim, and Expedia may participate in the

consent to the entry of any settlement or judgment without Expedia’s prior written consent, which consent will not

part of this Agreement or suspend your access to the Expedia System if required by law. Expedia may also suspend

your access to the Expedia System at any time and in its sole discretion, for whatever reason (including without

cause). Expedia will notify you of any termination or suspension and, where relevant, give you reasons for the

termination or suspension. Additionally, either you or Expedia may terminate this Agreement for any reason by

providing at least 30 days prior written notice to the other. m. Governing Law; Venue.
