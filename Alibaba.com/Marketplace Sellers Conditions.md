4\. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BUYERS AND SUPPLIERS
---------------------------------------------

4.1 Through the Sites, Alibaba.com provides an electronic web-based platform for exchanging information and concluding sale and purchase transactions of products and services online between buyers and suppliers. Alibaba.com reserves the right to limit certain features and functions of the platform to prescribed Members. Despite the provision of the platform through the Sites, Alibaba.com does not represent the seller or the buyer in specific transactions whether or not such transactions are made on or via the Sites. Alibaba.com does not control and is not liable to or responsible for the quality, safety, lawfulness or availability of the products or services offered for sale on the Sites or the ability of the suppliers to complete a sale or the ability of buyers to complete a purchase.

4.2 Members are hereby made aware that there may be risks of dealing with people acting under false pretences. Alibaba.com uses several techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the Sites. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, Alibaba.com cannot and does not confirm each free member's purported identity shown on the Sites and can only use reasonable efforts to verify the personal identity of the representative of a seller in mainland China opening a storefront on www.aliexpress.com according to the applicable laws in mainland China. We encourage you to use the various tools available on the Sites, as well as common sense, to evaluate with whom you are dealing.

4.3 Each Member accessing or using the Sites or Service shall fully assume the risks of conducting any purchase and sale transactions in connection with or through the Sites or Service . Such risks shall include, but not limited to, mis-representation of products and services, fraudulent schemes, unsatisfactory quality, failure to meet specifications, defective products, delay or default in delivery or payment, cost mis-calculations, breach of warranty, breach of contract and transportation accidents ("Transaction Risks"). Each Member agrees that Alibaba.com shall not be liable or responsible for any damages, liabilities, costs, harms, inconveniences, business disruptions or expenditures of any kind that may arise a result of or in connection with any Transaction Risks.

4.4 Members are solely responsible for setting out, agreeing on, entering into and performing all of the terms and conditions of the transactions conducted on, through or as a result of use of the Sites, including, without limitation, terms regarding payment, returns, warranties, shipping, insurance, fees, taxes, title, licenses, fines, permits, handling, transportation and storage, subject to any additional obligations imposed under the [Transactional Services Agreement](https://rule.alibaba.com/rule/detail/2054.htm?spm=a271m.8038972.1999288231.8.52ba6d82Fvpd25)(and in particular, clause 3.2).

4.5 Member agrees to provide all information and materials as may be reasonably required by Alibaba.com in connection with its transactions made via the transactional platform on the Sites. Alibaba.com has the right to suspend or terminate any Member’s Account if the Member fails to provide the required information and materials without liability for any losses or damages arising out of or in connection with such suspension or termination.

4.6 In the event that any Member has a dispute with any party to a transaction, such Member agrees to release and indemnify Alibaba.com (and our agents, affiliates, directors, officers and employees) from all claims, demands, actions, proceedings, costs, expenses and damages (including without limitation any actual, special, incidental or consequential damages) arising out of or in connection with such dispute or the transaction.

5\. USE OF DISCUSSION BOARDS ON THE SITE
----------------------------------------

5.2 Each Member acknowledges that all data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted through a discussion board on the Sites, are the sole responsibility of such Member from whom the Content originated.

Alibaba.com does not control the Content posted via discussion boards and therefore does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content.

5.3 Alibaba.com reserves the right to, but shall have no obligation to, delete or edit any postings in its sole discretion without prior notice. Alibaba.com may but shall not be obliged to monitor posting activities of any Member who is in breach of this Agreement and may restrict their ability to post messages on the discussion boards on the Sites. Under no circumstances will Alibaba.com be liable in any way for any Content, including (without limitation) any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the discussion boards by such Member. Each Member agrees to evaluate and bear all risks associated with the use of any Content including any reliance on its accuracy or completeness. Each Member understands that by using the Alibaba.com discussion boards on the Sites, such Member may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable.

5.4 Without prejudice to each Member's responsibilities under clause 3 of this Agreement, each Member agrees not to use the discussion boards on the Sites to:
