1\. Reverb is a Marketplace/Venue
---------------------------------

  

Reverb acts as a marketplace/venue to allow users who comply with Reverb's Terms of Use and policies to offer, sell, advertise, and buy musical instruments and related merchandise. While Reverb has processes in place to review the veracity and propriety of listings and to vet buyers and sellers, it cannot guarantee the truth, accuracy or legality of listings or the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items.  Reverb also cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. Reverb encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Site. You may also wish to consider using a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification. You agree that to the fullest extent protected by law, Reverb is a marketplace/venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other users, or third parties on Reverb. **YOU USE THE REVERB SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND AGREE THAT THE SITE IS PROVIDED TO YOU WITH ALL FAULTS, INCLUDING NO PROMISE OF CONTINUOUS SERVICE (SEE SECTION 16 BELOW). PLEASE ALSO SEE THE SECTIONS ON NO WARRANTIES (SECTION 11), LIMITATION ON LIABILITIES (SECTION 12) AND INDEMNITIES (SECTION 15) BELOW.**

3\. Fees and Services
---------------------

  

Joining and setting up a shop on Reverb is free. Reverb does not charge fees to list an item for sale. Reverb does charge a percentage of the sale price when the item sells. When you list an item you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. [Reverb’s Billing Policy](https://reverb.com/page/service-fee-2020), which is subject to change, is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Changes to the Billing Policy and the fees for Reverb's services are effective immediately after posting the changes on the Site to the fullest extent permitted by law, or otherwise immediately after the minimum period permitted by law. Reverb may also choose to temporarily change the Billing Policy and the fees for Reverb's services for promotional events (for example, free selling days); such changes are effective when Reverb posts the temporary promotional event on the Site or otherwise notifies you of the change.

**Fees and Termination:** If Reverb terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Reverb fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Reverb for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel). **YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT REVERB MAY CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD, OR ANY OTHER METHOD OF PAYMENT, ON FILE FOR ANY AND ALL OUTSTANDING OR DELINQUENT FEES OR BALANCES AND WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST REVERB FOR EXERCISING THIS RIGHT (INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, USING YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION TO AID IN COLLECTING PAYMENT).** If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge, contact Reverb. [Read About Reverb’s Billing Policy](https://reverb.com/page/service-fee-2020)

4\. Content License
-------------------

  

**(A) Your Content:** Reverb does not claim ownership rights in content you place on the Site or in your listings (the “Content”). You understand that you are solely responsible for Your Content. You represent that you have all necessary rights to Your Content and that you’re not infringing or violating any third party’s rights by posting it. You grant Reverb a license solely to enable Reverb to use any information or Content you supply Reverb with, so that Reverb is not violating any rights you might have in that Content. By posting Your Content through our Services, You grant Reverb a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right to use, display, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, store, and prepare derivative works of Your Content. This allows us to provide the Services and to promote Reverb, your Reverb shop, or the Services in general, in any formats and through any channels, including across any Reverb Services, our partners, or third-party website or advertising medium. You agree not to assert any moral rights or rights of publicity against us for using Your Content. You also recognize our legitimate interest in using it, in accordance with the scope of this license, to the extent Your Content contains any personal information. You agree to allow Reverb to store or re-format your Content on Reverb and display your Content on Reverb in any way as Reverb chooses. Reverb can also use any transactional information including sale date and final price for sales completed on Reverb as it sees fit.

**(B) Personal Information:** Reverb will only use personal information in accordance with Reverb's [Privacy Policy](https://reverb.com/page/privacy). As part of a transaction, you may obtain personal information, including email address and shipping information, from another Reverb user. Without obtaining prior permission from the other user, this personal information shall only be used for that transaction or for Reverb-related communications. Reverb has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages or for any other purpose. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Reverb user to your email or physical mail list. For more information, see [Reverb’s Privacy Policy](https://reverb.com/page/privacy).

**(C) Re-Posting Content:** By posting Content on Reverb, it is possible for an outside website or a third party to re-post or index that Content. You agree to hold Reverb harmless for any dispute concerning this use, along with the limitations on liability and indemnification provisions below. If you choose to display your own Reverb-hosted image on another website, the image must provide a link back to its listing page on Reverb.

**(D) Idea Submissions:** Reverb considers any unsolicited suggestions, ideas, proposals or other material submitted to it by users via the Site or otherwise (other than the Content and the tangible items sold on the Site by users) (collectively, the "Material") to be non-confidential and non-proprietary, and Reverb shall not be liable for the disclosure or use of such Material. If, at Reverb's request, any member sends Material to improve the site (for example through the Forums or to customer support), Reverb will also consider that Material to be non-confidential and non-proprietary and Reverb will not be liable for use or disclosure of the Material. Any communication by you to Reverb is subject to this Agreement. You hereby grant and agree to grant Reverb, under all of your rights in the Material, a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully-paid, sublicensable and transferable right and license to incorporate, make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, export, publicly display, publicly distribute, create derivative use from, publish and in all other ways exploit such Material for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, including but not limited to incorporating it in the API, documentation, or any product or service, without compensation or accounting to you and without further recourse by you.

5\. Information Control
-----------------------

  

Reverb does not control the Content provided by users that is made available on Reverb. You may find some Content to be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, or deceptive. Reverb users must be eighteen or over, but there are risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense. Additionally, there may also be risks dealing with international trade and foreign nationals. By using Reverb, you agree to accept such risks and expressly agree that Reverb (and Reverb's officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) is not responsible for any and all acts or omissions of users on Reverb. Please use caution, common sense, and practice safe buying and selling when using Reverb.

**Other Resources:** Reverb is not responsible for the availability of outside websites or resources linked to or referenced on the Site. Reverb does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such websites or resources. You agree that Reverb shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such websites or resources.

6\. Disputes, Arbitration, Class Waiver, Waiver of Claims and Venue
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  

**(A) Arbitration:** In the event a dispute arises between you and Reverb, please contact Reverb. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in Cook County, Illinois, using the English language administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can find the AAA Rules here), unless otherwise required by law. \*\*Arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the dispute, will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules, and in the case of CEDR, its rules.  
For EU sellers, if any dispute arises in connection with these Terms of Use, the parties should first try to resolve the dispute through the complaints procedure published here. In addition, the dispute may be referred by either party to the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (“CEDR”) for mediation. The Parties agree to enter into mediation to settle a good faith dispute and will do so in accordance with the CEDR’s mediation procedures. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties within 14 days of notice of the dispute, the mediator will be nominated by CEDR. To initiate the mediation a party must give notice in writing to the other party to the dispute, referring the dispute to mediation. A copy of the referral should be sent to CEDR.

 

**(B) Class Action and Collective Action Waiver: The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this Agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The tribunal shall rule on its own jurisdiction and the validity or enforceability of the agreement to arbitrate.**

 

**(C) Enforcement of Arbitration Judgment:** Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.

**(D) Jurisdiction and Venue:** For all purposes of any injunctive or equitable proceeding, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts or state courts located in the Northern District of Illinois. Use of the Site is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Agreement, including without limitation, this section.

**(E) Limitations Period:** You and Reverb agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Site, Services or this Agreement must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.

**(F) Intra-User Disputes and EU Dispute:** In the event that you have a dispute with another Reverb user or third party, we encourage you to contact the other party and try to resolve the dispute directly. Should you have a dispute with one or more users, or an outside party, YOU RELEASE REVERB (AND REVERB'S OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND EMPLOYEES) FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. Reverb encourages users to report any unlawful activity to your local law enforcement, and to use a certified mediation or arbitration entity, as applicable.

For disputes located in the EU, the European ADR Directive ( EU Directive 2013/11 / EU) on Alternative Dispute Resolution may be used. The Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform for these issues is located [here](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). Sellers will be obliged to provide their email address in order to use the ODR platform.

**(G) Order Disputes:** Issues related to transactions on Reverb can usually be resolved via direct communication between the buyer and the seller. If a buyer and seller are unable to resolve a dispute, Reverb, may be able to help. You can find more details about when Reverb may be able to assist in the Community Rules policies for [Buyers](https://reverb.com/page/buyers) and [Sellers](https://reverb.com/page/sellers).

Reverb does so in Reverb's sole discretion, and Reverb has no obligation to resolve disputes between users or between users and outside parties. To the extent that Reverb attempts to resolve a dispute, Reverb will do so in good faith based solely on Reverb's policies. IN THE EVENT REVERB INVOLVES ITSELF IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN CUSTOMERS, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE AND RELEASE REVERB (AND REVERB'S OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND EMPLOYEES) FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE DISPUTE.

If you are a party to a dispute, Reverb may contact you while attempting to resolve the dispute. If you do not respond to Reverb's inquiry regarding a dispute within forty-eight (48) hours, Reverb reserves the right to resolve the dispute at its discretion and you agree that any such resolution will be binding on you.

**(H) Feedback: REVERB WILL NOT AMEND, ALTER OR OTHERWISE CHANGE FEEDBACK LEFT BETWEEN USERS UNLESS THE CONTENT IS FALSE, UNREASONABLY INFLAMMATORY OR OTHERWISE IN VIOLATION OF REVERB POLICIES AS DETERMINED BY REVERB IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. FULLY REFUNDED ORDERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEEDBACK.**

**(I) Full Waiver: YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE AND RELEASE REVERB (AND REVERB'S OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND EMPLOYEES) FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE SITE, SERVICES OR YOUR USE OF THE SAME.**

7\. Financing Vendors/Layaway
-----------------------------

Reverb's trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, patents, and all other Reverb intellectual property (including Reverb Integrations) may not be used, in any manner, without the prior express written consent of a duly authorized representative of Reverb or in violation of or inconsistently with these Terms of Use.

10\. Access and Interference
----------------------------

  

Reverb may contain robot exclusion headers which contain internal rules for software usage. Much of the information on Reverb is updated on a real-time basis and is proprietary or is licensed to Reverb by Reverb's users or third-parties. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access Reverb for any purpose whatsoever, except to the extent expressly permitted by Reverb's with prior express written permission.

You will not copy, publicly reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, publicly distribute or publicly display any user Content, including via use of plug-ins, extensions, applications or scripts that interfere with the Content, features, or functions of the Site or Services. You will not interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site or any activities conducted on the Site. And you will not bypass Reverb's robot exclusion headers or other measures Reverb may use to prevent or restrict access to Reverb.

11\. Breach of Reverb Terms of Use and Policies
-----------------------------------------------

  

Without limiting its legal recourse or any other remedies, Reverb may, without notice, and without refunding any fees, delay or immediately remove Content, warn Reverb's community of a user's actions, issue a warning to a user, temporarily suspend a user, temporarily or indefinitely suspend a user's account privileges, terminate a user's account, prohibit access to the Site, take technical and legal steps to keep a user off the Site and refuse to provide services to a user for any reason, including, for example if any of the following apply: (a) Reverb suspects (by information, investigation, conviction, settlement, insurance or escrow investigation, or otherwise) a user has breached this Agreement, including the [Privacy Policy](https://reverb.com/page/privacy), [Intellectual Property Policy](https://reverb.com/legal/reverbcom-Intellectual-Property-Policy), the [Community Rules](https://reverb.com/page/terms) or other policies and community guidelines incorporated herein; (b) Reverb is unable to verify or authenticate any of your personal information or Content; (c) Reverb believes that a user is acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of Reverb's [Community Rules](https://reverb.com/page/terms) or policies; or (d) Reverb believes a user has engaged in improper or fraudulent activity in connection with Reverb or the actions may cause legal liability or financial loss to Reverb's users or to Reverb. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Reverb retains the right to suspend or terminate a user should we have reason to believe you, your Content, or your use of our Services have violated our Terms of Use or Community Rules. **Use of the Site is a privilege, not a right.**

12\. No Warranty
----------------

  

REVERB IS DEDICATED TO MAKING OUR SERVICES THE BEST THEY CAN BE, BUT WE’RE NOT PERFECT AND SOMETIMES THINGS CAN GO WRONG. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT OUR SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY KIND OF WARRANTY (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED). WE ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMING ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS WELL AS ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY A COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING, OR USAGE OF TRADE.

REVERB’S SUBSIDIARIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AGENTS AND SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, PERFORMANCE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION (ORAL OR WRITTEN) OBTAINED BY YOU FROM REVERB SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

13\. Limitation of Liability
----------------------------

  

IN NO EVENT SHALL REVERB, AND (AS APPLICABLE) REVERB’S SUBSIDIARIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, GENERAL, SPECIAL, COMPENSATORY, CONSEQUENTIAL, AND/OR INCIDENTAL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE CONDUCT OF YOU OR ANYONE ELSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SITE, REVERB’S SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, BODILY INJURY, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

14\. CITES and Claims Release
-----------------------------

  

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international agreement intended to limit cross-border trade in endangered plants, woods and wildlife.  Among the endangered species included in CITES are all forms of Rosewood including, but not limited to, Brazilian Rosewood, Panamanian Rosewood, Black Rosewood, African Rosewood and Honduran Rosewood. For years, Rosewood has been used to manufacture musical instruments dictating that the cross-border transfer of musical instruments containing even limited amounts of Rosewood may be subject to the prohibitions set forth in CITES. Accordingly, by selling and shipping an instrument internationally, you acknowledge that Reverb has informed you of the potential prohibitions set forth in CITES.  AS SUCH, YOU AGREE TO ACCEPT AND ASSUME ANY AND ALL RISKS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL LOSS, INJURY, DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION OR CONFISCATION OF YOUR PROPERTY DUE TO VIOLATIONS OF CITES.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE CAREFULLY READ THIS PROVISION AND HEREBY RELEASE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST REVERB RELATED TO FINANCIAL LOSS, INJURY, DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION OR CONFISCATION OF YOUR PROPERTY DUE TO VIOLATIONS OF CITES AND AGREED TO HOLD REVERB AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS HARMLESS AGAINST ANY SUCH CLAIMS.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A COMPLETE RELEASE OF LIABILITY AGAINST REVERB.COM WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH CITES.

15\. Indemnity
--------------

  

YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD REVERB AND (AS APPLICABLE) REVERB'S PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, AND EMPLOYEES, HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM OR DEMAND, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES, MADE BY ANY THIRD PARTY DUE TO OR ARISING OUT OF YOUR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE [PRIVACY POLICY](https://reverb.com/page/privacy), THE [COMMUNITY RULES](https://reverb.com/page/terms) OR THE DOCUMENTS THEY INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE, OR YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OR THE RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY COLLECT AND REMIT TAXES ON ANY SALES.

We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, even if you are indemnifying us, in which case you agree to cooperate with us so we can execute our strategy.

16\. No Guarantee of Continuous Service
---------------------------------------

  

Reverb does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted access to the Site and no SLA representations or guarantees are included herein. Operation of the Site may be interfered with by numerous factors outside Reverb's control.

17\. Intellectual Property Policy
---------------------------------

  

Reverb takes intellectual property infringement very seriously. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. Copyright law. Additional laws apply to trademark rights and other types of rights in the U.S. and worldwide. You may not post, distribute, or reproduce in any way any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary information without obtaining all necessary prior written consents of the owner(s) of such proprietary rights. If you do so repeatedly on the Site, you will be removed as a user. Without limiting the foregoing, if content that you own or have rights to has been posted to the Services without your permission and you want it removed, please follow the steps listed in our  [Intellectual Property Policy](https://reverb.com/legal/reverbcom-Intellectual-Property-Policy).

18\. Trademarks for Modified Instruments
----------------------------------------

  

Users of the Site who engage in modifications of instruments or gear may be prohibited from referring to those items by their original trademarked names.

In addition, you shall be responsible for paying any and all taxes applicable to any purchases or sales of items you make on the Site (excluding any taxes on Reverb's net income).

23\. Proposition 65 - California
--------------------------------

  

The California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Prop 65”) requires manufacturers, producers, packagers, importers, suppliers or distributors (the “Notice Parties”) of products to provide warnings to California consumers about potentially hazardous or cancer-causing materials in those products.  Notice Parties are encouraged to include a warning that lists the specific chemicals in the product(s) if they are present in an amount that may be hazardous. Example warnings could read:

**WARNING: This product can expose you to chemicals, including \[name of chemical\], which is/are known to the State of California to cause cancer. For more information, go to www.P65Warnings.ca.gov.**

**WARNING: This product can expose you to chemicals, including \[name of chemical\], which is/are known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. For more information, go to www.P65Warnings.ca.gov.**

We encourage all Reverb users who sell to California residents to investigate the requirements and to make independent determinations about whether warnings are necessary when selling items to California residents.  You can include warnings in your item descriptions on Reverb. You agree to indemnify and hold Reverb harmless for any violations of Prop 65 or any claims arising out of your violation of Prop 65.
