AbeBooks Seller Agreement
=========================

This Version Effective September 20, 2018

Welcome to AbeBooks, and thank you for joining us to list your products for sale. This agreement explains what AbeBooks does, what you do, and how we work together.

1\. How to Become an AbeBooks Seller
------------------------------------

AbeBooks Inc. ("AbeBooks", "Us", "We" "Our") operates a number of Web Sites (collectively, the "Web Sites" and each a "Web Site") and provides services (collectively, the "Services") that allow people and entities ("Customers") to purchase items as described in the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/) (collectively, "Items") from sellers. In this agreement, you will be referred to as a "Seller", "You" or "Your." This agreement incorporates the [AbeBooks Program Guide](#programguide), the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/), and the [Fee Schedule](#feeschedule) (together, the Agreement). If You want to list and sell Items through the Web Sites or use the Services, You must:

1. Complete and submit an [AbeBooks Membership Application](https://www.abebooks.com/books/Sell/); and
2. Read this Agreement, the [AbeBooks Program Guide](#programguide), the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/), and the [Fee Schedule](#feeschedule), and signify Your acceptance and agreement to them by clicking on the \[I accept\] button at the end of this Agreement.
3. If applicable, You will be required to agree to terms with Our external payment service provider (External Payment Service Provider).  
    

Once We have accepted Your membership application, and provided You have clicked on the \[I accept\] button, You will be bound by this Agreement.

2\. Who Can List
----------------

Only valid and existing corporations or individuals who are at least the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence and can enter into legally binding and enforceable contracts may become an AbeBooks seller.

3\. Policies and Fees
---------------------

We have policies and procedures with respect to the use of the Web Sites and Services, including transactions conducted through the Web Sites. The policies and procedures are set out in the [AbeBooks Program Guide](#programguide) and the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/). You will ensure that Your use of the Web Sites and Services complies with Our policies and procedures and the Agreement. AbeBooks reserves the right to prohibit the listing of or remove specific Items (including publicly banned items, where applicable) or only allow listing items from selected sellers based on the requirements of the specific Web Site.

There are fees and other payments payable by You to AbeBooks (either directly or through Our External Payment Service Provider) for use of the Web Sites and Services, including for some transactions conducted through the Web Sites. These fees and payments are set out in the [AbeBooks Program Guide](#programguide) and the [Fee Schedule](#feeschedule).

4\. Changes to the Agreement
----------------------------

We may, from time to time, need to make changes to the Agreement. It is Your responsibility to check the Agreement from time to time to ensure You are aware of any changes. If We make any changes to the Agreement, We will inform You of the changes either by posting a notice on the Web Sites or by sending an e-mail to You. If You continue to participate in or use the Web Sites or Services after the changes are effective, that will mean that You have accepted and agreed to the changes.

5\. Listing Your Items
----------------------

In order for Us to list Your Items on the Web Sites, We need certain information about all the Items that You will list for sale on the Web Sites. This information is referred to as the "Product File". We cannot list Your Items without a Product File, so You agree to provide Us with the Product File and agree that We can use it to list Your Items on the Web Sites and provide Services.

You retain ownership of the Product File and all copyright and other intellectual property rights associated with the Product File, subject to the following license. To allow Us to list Your Items on the Web Sites and provide Services, You grant to Us all necessary rights to use, copy, display, perform, modify, and create derivative works of the Product File (including converting the information in the Product File, if required, to import into Our database) to present the Product File on the Web Sites and generally in association with providing the Services.

If Items listed in Your Product File do not have an ISBN associated with them, We may in Our absolute discretion provide an ISBN for such Items using Our ISBN Matching Service prior to listing such Items on the Web Sites. Our ISBN Matching Service is based upon third party information that may not be accurate, and occasionally errors occur. You are responsible for verifying any ISBN that We provide. You are solely responsible and liable for verifying the accuracy of all information contained in each order You receive, including without limitation the ISBN number for each ordered Item, before accepting the order. We are not responsible or liable to You or any other person for any loss or damage arising from, related to or connected with any ISBN numbers We may provide for any Items listed in Your Product File, including without limitation any costs associated with Item returns, refunds, or reimbursements due to erroneous ISBN numbers.

Before You provide Us with the Product File, You must ensure that:

1. You have the legal right to offer and sell the Items listed in the Product File;
2. The Product File and the Items listed in the Product File comply with all applicable laws, the [AbeBooks Program Guide](#programguide) and the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/);
3. The Product File, Our use of the Product File, and the offer and sale by You of the Items listed in the Product File will not infringe the rights (including copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights) of any person or entity or violate any applicable laws; and
4. The offer and sale by You of the Items listed in the Product File, and the contents of the Product File, do not constitute false advertising and are not misleading in any respect.  
    

You will ensure that all information You provide to Us, including membership application, Product File, and financial information, is true, accurate, current and complete. We will rely on the information You provide. You will be solely responsible and liable for any and all loss, damage, and additional costs that You, Us or any other person may incur as a result of Your submission of any false, incorrect or incomplete information.

In addition to the requirements and restrictions set forth in the [AbeBooks Program Guide](#programguide), You may not include in the Product File or otherwise advertise for sale on the Web Sites or sell through the Web Sites any Items the possession, advertisement or sale of which to any persons or class of persons (including minors) are prohibited by law in any of the jurisdictions in which You, Your business or the relevant Customer is located, or which may infringe the rights of any other person or entity, or which are prohibited by the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/).

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Us and Our officers, directors, employees, and agents from any and all third-party claims, liabilities, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, arising out of or related to a breach of Your promises and agreements set forth in the Agreement, including in this Section 5.

6\. Codes
---------

You may have to use one or more usernames or passwords (collectively "Codes") provided by Us to access or use parts of the Web Sites or the Services. We are not obligated to verify the actual identity or authority of any person using Codes to access and use the Web Sites or Services. We may act upon any communication that is given with the use of Codes. We may in Our discretion at any time require proof of the identity and authority of any person seeking to access and use the Web Sites or Services, and may deny access to and use of the Web Sites and Services or refuse to accept or act upon any communication if We are not satisfied with such proof. If We in Our discretion consider any Code to be insecure or to have been used inappropriately, then We may immediately suspend or cancel any and all Codes without any notice or liability to You or any other person.

If You have been issued Codes: (a) You are fully responsible and liable for the security of the Codes and any and all use and misuse of the Codes; (b) You will keep the Codes secure and confidential at all times and not disclose the Codes to any unauthorized person; (c) You will ensure that all uses of the Codes comply with the Agreement; and (d) You will immediately notify Us if You know or suspect that any of the Codes have been lost or stolen or become known to or used by any other person.

7\. Service Providers
---------------------

If You engage third party service providers to manage Your Items listed on the Web Sites, to process transactions on Your behalf, or to otherwise assist You in Your dealings with AbeBooks or Your access or use of the Web Sites or Services, You are and will remain fully responsible and liable to AbeBooks for all acts and omissions of all such service providers.

8\. Confidentiality of Customer Data
------------------------------------

As a Seller, You will receive certain information, including personal and payment information (for Seller Direct Orders (defined in the [AbeBooks Program Guide](#programguide))), about Customers and other users of the Web Sites (collectively, "Customer Data"). You may use the Customer Data only for the purpose of fulfilling an accepted order to which the particular Customer Data relates, and You may not use or disclose Customer Data for any other purpose. Without limiting the foregoing, You may not disclose, sell, license or otherwise transfer any Customer Data to any third party or use any Customer Data for the transmission of "junk mail", "spam", marketing communications or other unsolicited distribution of information.

You must treat the Customer Data with the same degree of care You accord Your own confidential and Customer information (but in any event with at least a reasonable degree of care), limit access to Customer Data only to those persons who need to know it to enable You to fulfill an accepted order, and use technical and physical security measures to protect the Customer Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.

You must ensure that Your use of Customer Data complies with all applicable laws (including laws regarding the protection of personal information and privacy and unsolicited communications), and You must cooperate and assist Us as reasonably required from time to time to comply with personal information protection and privacy laws and the AbeBooks' [Privacy Policy](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/Legal/privacyPolicy.shtml) as amended from time to time as applicable to the Customer Data. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, You must amend, delete, return, or cease using Customer Data as We may request from time to time, and allow Us to inspect and audit Your use, disclosure, retention, and protection of Customer Data.

9\. We Respect Your Privacy
---------------------------

Your personal information will be collected and saved by Us. Personal information We collect from You is treated confidentially as required by applicable law and as set out in Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/Legal/privacyPolicy.shtml). We will treat Your data and confidential information with the same degree of care with which We treat Our own confidential information.

10\. Our Role in Transactions
-----------------------------

We facilitate transactions between You and Customers. You are the seller in all of Your transactions with Customers. We do not take title to Items that You list on the Web Sites or sell to Customers through the Web Sites or Using the Services, and We are not a party to those transactions.

You hereby appoint us as your payment processing agent for the limited purpose of receiving payments on your behalf from users that authorize payments to you directly or to third-party services that enable transactions with you. Users will receive a receipt upon payment that will indicate that payment has been made on the applicable date. Our obligation to remit funds collected by us on your behalf shall be limited to the applicable portion of funds as specified in this Agreement that we have actually received and that are not subject to chargeback or reversal, and we shall have no obligation to pursue any collection action against any user. Receipt of funds from users by us on your behalf in connection with Service transactions shall be deemed receipt of funds from users by you and will satisfy the obligations owed to you by users in the amount of the applicable payment by the user, even if we fail to remit such funds received from users.

Regardless of Our role in facilitating Your transactions with Customers, the transactions are solely between You and the Customers, and You are solely and fully responsible and liable for all of Your transactions with Customers.

Except as otherwise stated in the [AbeBooks Program Guide](#programguide), You are solely responsible for collecting and remitting to the relevant authorities in a timely and proper manner all sales, value-added and other taxes and any and all other required withholdings, duties and charges (Taxes) relating to all of Your transactions with Customers. We may collect and remit Taxes on Your behalf in order to comply with applicable law (Specified Taxes) to the extent specified in the [AbeBooks Program Guide](#programguide). We have no obligation to remit Specified Taxes to You.

11\. Your Responsibility for Claims/Refunds
-------------------------------------------

You are fully responsible for, and will defend, indemnify and hold Us harmless against, any and all claims, liabilities, obligations and expenses arising from, connected with or relating to Your transactions and other dealings with Customers or any breach of the Agreement by You or any person for whom You are in law responsible.

Without limiting the foregoing, if a Customer makes a complaint regarding a transaction, We may in Our discretion cause the Customer to be given a refund of all payments made by the Customer in respect of the transaction, and You will indemnify Us for any such refunds.

Our Returns policy for orders is outlined in detail in the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/).

12\. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability
---------------------------------------------

Your use of the Web Sites and Services is at Your own risk. The Web Sites and Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and without any representations, warranties or conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, and including without limitation implied conditions, warranties or representations of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, performance or durability, all of which are hereby waived by You and disclaimed by Us to the fullest extent permitted by law. The operation of the Web Sites and the provision of Services may be affected by numerous factors beyond Our control, and may not be continuous or uninterrupted or secure. Security and privacy risks cannot be eliminated.

All transactions with Customers are at Your own risk. We are not a party to any transactions and disclaim any and all liability regarding all transactions. We do not verify the identity of Customers or other users of the Web Sites, the truth or accuracy of information submitted by Customers or users of the Web Sites, or the ability of Customers to complete transactions.

We will not under any circumstances be liable to You or any other person for any loss of use, loss of production, loss of income or profits (anticipated or otherwise), loss of business opportunities, economic loss, special, indirect or consequential loss or damage or punitive damages, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of law or equity, arising from, connected with, or relating to the access to or use of the Web Sites or Services by You or any other person, and regardless of any negligence or other fault or wrongdoing (including fundamental breach) by Us or any person for whom We are responsible, and notwithstanding that We may have been advised of the possibility of such loss or damages being incurred by You or any other person.

In no event will Our total liability to You or any other person for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, and costs, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of law or equity, and regardless of any negligence or other fault or wrongdoing (including fundamental breach) by Us or any person for whom We are responsible, exceed the lesser of US $100 or the purchase price of the Items (plus out-of-pocket shipping costs) that are the subject of the claim.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You hereby release AbeBooks from any and all obligations, liabilities, claims or demands in excess of the limitations and exclusions set forth above in this Section 12.

The above liability restrictions will not apply in the case of willful misconduct or gross negligence by AbeBooks. Any further mandatory statutory liability of AbeBooks for bodily harm or damage to health or arising from statutory regulations of the country specific product liability law remains unaffected.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, AbeBooks will not under any circumstances be liable to You or any other person for any loss or damage arising from, connected with, or relating to the downloading of data (including computer software) from the Web Sites or through the Services.

The exclusion of certain warranties and the exclusion or limitation of certain liabilities is prohibited by legislation in some jurisdictions. Such legislative limitations may apply to You.

In this Section 12, references to "AbeBooks" include AbeBooks and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents.

13\. Term and Termination of the Agreement
------------------------------------------

The Agreement is for an indefinite term. Either You or We may terminate the Agreement at any time for convenience effective immediately upon written notice of termination to the other. We may at any time and in Our discretion immediately suspend or terminate (in whole or in part) Your permission to use the Web Sites and Services without any notice or liability to You or any other person.

Upon termination of the Agreement, You will pay to Us all unpaid fees and payments to the date of termination, and We will (or cause Our External Payment Service Provider to) pay to You any balance due.

If You or We terminate the Agreement or Your permission to use the Web Sites or Services for any reason, the Agreement will nevertheless continue to apply and be binding upon You in respect of Your prior use of the Web Sites and Services and Your prior transactions with Customers and anything connected with, relating to or arising from those matters. We reserve the right, in Our sole discretion, to cause payments to be withheld from You so that the funds can be used for returns, refunds and chargebacks.

Also, if the Agreement is terminated by You or by Us, certain provisions need to survive. Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 of this Agreement and Sections 4.3 and 6 in the [AbeBooks Program Guide](#programguide) and policies regarding Returns, Refunds, Taxes and Duties in the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/) will survive indefinitely and continue to be binding upon You and Us.

14\. Ownership of the Web Sites and Other AbeBooks Property
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Web Sites and all information (in text, graphical, video and audio forms), images, icons, software, designs, applications, calculators, models, data, and other elements available on or through the Web Sites or the Services (collectively, the "Web Site Content") are Our property and the property of others, and are protected by Canadian and international copyright, trade-mark, and other laws. Your participation in or use of the Web Sites or the Services does not transfer to You any ownership or any other rights or interests in the Web Sites or the Web Site Content.

Unless otherwise stated in the Agreement, the Web Sites and the Web Site Content may not be copied, displayed, published, uploaded, posted, transmitted, modified, indexed, catalogued, framed, mirrored, scraped, data-mined or distributed in any way, in whole or in part, without Our express prior written consent. You may not use any of the software that is used in the operation of the Web Sites or the provision of Services except while You are using the Web Sites or Services.

Your use of Our HomeBase software is subject to the applicable software license agreement.

15\. Right of Offset
--------------------

To simplify Your payment processes and Ours, We need to have the ability to offset monies owing to each other. We may offset against monies owing to You any monies You owe to Us, including for any Specified Taxes for Seller Direct Orders. Additionally, We may cause Our External Payment Service Provider to pay monies owed to Us from monies that would otherwise be paid to You by Our External Payment Service Provider. You may offset against monies owing to Us any monies We owe to You, but only if We agree in writing to the offset.

16\. Applicable Laws and Dispute Resolution
-------------------------------------------

The Web Sites are controlled by Us from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The Agreement, participation in, access to and use of the Web Sites and the Services, and all related matters, are governed solely by the laws of British Columbia, Canada and applicable federal laws of Canada, excluding any rules of private international law or the conflict of laws that would lead to the application of any other laws.

For all disputes arising from, connected with or relating to the Web Sites, the Services, the Agreement, transactions facilitated or conducted through the Web Sites or Services, Items ordered or purchased through the Web Sites, dealings between You and Us, or any related matters or any legal relationship associated therewith or derived therefrom ("Disputes"), You and We will attempt to find a reasonable, least onerous solution. If a Dispute cannot be resolved by You and Us, then the Dispute will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre (the "BCICAC") by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with those rules. The case will be administered by the BCICAC in accordance with its rules. The arbitration and all related matters will be confidential. The place of arbitration will be Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. If the BCICAC is not operative, the arbitration will proceed ad hoc and be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Act (British Columbia) or the International Commercial Arbitration Act (British Columbia), as appropriate to the parties. The place of arbitration is the City of Vancouver, British Columbia and the language to be used in the arbitration is the English language. The award rendered in any arbitration commenced hereunder is final and conclusive and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction for its enforcement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, You or AbeBooks may seek injunctive relief from an appropriate court located in Vancouver, British Columbia regarding any Dispute prior to or during the settlement negotiation or arbitration of the Dispute, and You hereby irrevocably submit and attorn to the original and exclusive jurisdiction of those courts in respect of all such matters.

Proceedings regarding Disputes must be commenced within six (6) months after the Dispute arises, after which time any and all proceedings regarding the Dispute are barred. Any shorter time limit provided by statute law remains unaffected. The time limitation set forth in this paragraph shall not apply to any of Your indemnification obligations under the Agreement.

17\. Other Matters
------------------

You must comply with all applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations.

If any provision of the Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect without being impaired or invalidated in any way, unless as a result of any such determination the Agreement would fail in its essential purpose.

You and We have expressly requested and required that the Agreement and all other related documents be drawn up in the English language. Les parties conviennent et exigent expressÃ©ment que ce Contrat et tous les documents qui s'y rapportent soient rÃ©digÃ©s en anglais.

Program Guide
-------------

The AbeBooks Program Guide is a comprehensive overview of how AbeBooks works and Our expectations of You as a participating Seller.

1\. Listing Items
-----------------

To list Your Items, You send Your Product File to Us by an electronic method including FTP, e-mail or through Our online facilities. You agree to provide Us with reasonable assistance when required regarding the Product File.

2\. Selling Items
-----------------

**2.1 Direct Buyer-Seller Contact and Inquiries** Customers may contact You directly through Our Web Sites to inquire about Items listed for sale. The contact information that You supply will be displayed with each Item, providing Customers with the ability to ask You questions directly. You are required to respond to all inquiries as per the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/).

**2.2 Orders** Customers can place orders with You for Items on Our Web Sites through Our Shopping Basket. The Shopping Basket is a step-by-step facilitated purchase process that sends CustomerÂ’s order details. You are required to process all orders in accordance with Our Seller Policies. All transactions through Our Web Sites are between You and the Customer and We do not become involved in the sale of the Item. All Items sold to Customers through the Shopping Basket will be subject to a commission (see [Fee Schedule](#feeschedule) for details). If an order does not result in an actual sale of an ordered Item, You will have 90 days from the date of accepting the order to request reimbursement for the commission charged on that Item.

At any time, both You and Customers are able to review the status of Items ordered through Our Shopping Basket on the Web Sites.

**2.3 Accepted Payment Methods** Payments to You made through Our Web Sites may be processed by an External Payment Service Provider. You may choose to accept additional payment methods such as bank transfers or accept payments directly from Customers (Seller Direct Orders). You may select these additional payment methods during the registration process, or update them at any time after registration.

3\. Pricing of Items
--------------------

AbeBooks will list Your available Items for sale through Our Web Sites based on Your list price ("List Price"). Because it is not feasible for Us to allow listings of items priced at less than US $1.00 (or equivalent), We reserve the right to increase the price of any Item to a listing price of US $1.00 or its equivalent when displaying the Item on Our search results. On Our international Web Sites where the buyer's currency is different from Your listing currency, We will convert Your List Price to the buyer's currency as described in Section 4.1.

4\. Fees and Payments
---------------------

**4.1 Payments to You** For orders processed by the External Payment Service Provider, You will be credited the List Price of the Item, plus any applicable shipping charges in Your billing currency, after You accept the order for the Item. You will be paid weekly by electronic funds transfer (EFT) (where available). If not available You will be paid monthly by alternative method. Payments to You may be converted from Your billing currency to the payment currency at a rate that covers currency conversion costs and short term rate fluctuation, based on a rate We reasonably select plus a spread (the Â“Effective Exchange RateÂ”). The actual rates paid by Us or Our External Payment Service Provider may be more or less than the Effective Exchange Rate depending on a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the applicable currency markets. Payments We owe to You may be offset against amounts You owe Us. Additionally, We may cause Our External Payment Service Provider to pay monies owed to Us from monies that would otherwise be paid to You by Our External Payment Service Provider. From time to time We or our External Payment Service Provider may place limits on the location of bank accounts for the purposes of payments to You under the Agreement. You will supply information upon request sufficient to allow Us to make EFT payments to You, and You will comply with Our requirements and Our External Payment Service Providers requirements with respect to disbursements to Your account. If AbeBooks suspects irregular or unusual activity, AbeBooks may cause all or any part of a payment to be delayed or cancelled.

For Seller Direct Orders, You will be solely responsible for collecting full payment for the orders from the Customer including any Specified Taxes or other Taxes.

**4.2 What You pay to Us** You are responsible for paying the fees described in the [Fee Schedule](#feeschedule). For Seller Direct Orders, You are also responsible for remitting to Us any Specified Taxes You collect from Customers.

**4.3 Taxes and Duties** You are responsible for the payment of all Taxes, if applicable, for Items sold through the Web Sites.

We do not collect or remit Taxes for Items sold through the Web Sites, except for the Specified Taxes specified [here](https://support.abebooks.com/buying/s/article/transaction-taxes?language=en_US), which we will remit to the relevant authorities on your behalf and will also include in the charges to Customers. We will collect Specified Taxes from Customers, other than for Seller Direct Orders.

**4.4 Chargebacks** AbeBooks reserves the right to cause any chargebacks We receive from Customers to be applied to You.

5\. Processing and Receipt of Orders
------------------------------------

You will receive order information through e-mail notification when orders are placed and You can also review new orders through the Web Site. You are required to process and ship Your orders as set out in the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/).

6\. Returns and Refunds
-----------------------

You will accept returns from Customers of orders placed on the Web Sites in accordance with the return policies specified in the [Seller Policies](https://www.abebooks.com/docs/BooksellerPolicies/). All refunds for returned Items paid for through the External Payment Service Provider will be managed by AbeBooks. You will either be invoiced for refunds or We will cause refunds to be debited against proceeds due from the External Payment Service Provider. You agree not to charge any restocking or similar fees in connection with returns and/or refunds.

7\. AbeBooks Account Information
--------------------------------

We will assign You a Client Identification Number and You will provide a user name (usually an e-mail address) and password for use in accessing Your AbeBooks seller accounts on one or more of the Web Sites. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your user name and password. You are fully responsible and liable for any and all use and misuse of them.

You must notify AbeBooks immediately if You know or suspect that any of Your, user name or password has been lost or stolen or has become known to or used by any unauthorized person.

Fee Schedule
------------

All currency in this Fee Schedule is in United States dollars. The purpose of this Fee Schedule is to explain the following items:

1. Subscription Fee Rates
2. Commission Fees and Payment Service Fees
3. Minimum/Maximum Prices
4. Statements  
    

The subscription fee, commission fees, and payment service fees are collectively the "Fees". You agree that We may, in Our sole discretion, require You to pay the Fees described in this schedule directly to Us or deduct Fees due to Us from amounts due to You.

1\. Subscription Fee Rates
--------------------------

The AbeBooks subscription fee entitles You to list Your Items on the AbeBooks Web Sites. The subscription fee is calculated based on the average number of total Items that were listed during the previous month. The subscription fee is debited from Your account on the 1st of each month for the current month. The first subscription fee will be debited from Your account as soon as Your seller account is activated and will be the minimum subscription fee pro-rated based on the number of days remaining in the month. For each day that Your account is in vacation status, Your number of listed Items is considered to be zero.

The following rate schedule outlines the subscription fee You will pay:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Number of Items** | **Rate per Month (USD)** |
| 0Â -Â 500 | $25 |
| 501Â -Â 4,000 | $37 |
| 4,001Â -Â 10,000 | $42 |
| 10,001Â -Â 20,000 | $53 |
| 20,001Â -Â 30,000 | $80 |
| 30,001Â -Â 50,000 | $125 |
| 50,001Â -Â 100,000 | $200 |
| 100,001Â -Â 150,000 | $300 |
| 150,001Â -Â 500,000 | $400 |
| 500,001+ | $500 |

2\. Commissions and Payment Service Fees Definitions:
-----------------------------------------------------

Total Item Amount: the full amount of the Item, which includes the Item price, shipping charges, and any extra charges on the Item, net of any Specified Taxes. Commissions are calculated using the Total Item Amount.

Total Order Amount: the sum of all Total Item Amounts in the order. Commissions and Payment Service Fees, as outlined below, are calculated using the Total Order Amount.

All items sold through Our Web Sites are subject to an 8% commission fee on the Total Item Amount. The minimum commission charged on any Item will be $0.50 and the maximum will be $40.00. Therefore Total Item Amounts of $6.25 or less will be charged a $0.50 flat commission fee and Total Item Amounts of $500.00 or greater will be charged a $40.00 flat commission fee.

Once an order is successfully accepted or deemed to have been accepted by You, We will assume that the order will result in a completed sale by You and will charge You the commission fee. If an order for which We have charged You a commission fee does not result in a completed sale, You will have 90 days from the date the order was accepted to request reimbursement for the commission fee charged on that Item.

When a Customer pays You through a Web Site using a payment method processed by the External Payment Service Provider, We will charge You a payment service fee on the Total Order Amount.

The applicable payment service fee for orders through the AbeBooks.com or AbeBooks.co.uk websites is 5.5% for orders where the amount charged to the buyer is less than $500.00 USD/Â£275.00 GBP/Â€400.00 EUR.

If the Total Order Amount exceeds $500.00/Â£275.00/Â€400.00 EUR according to the buyer's currency, a blended payment service fee is applied to the order. This blended rate is calculated based on 5.5% of the first $500.00 USD/Â£275.00 GBP/Â€400.00 EUR plus 3.5% of the remainder, divided by the Total Order Amount. Once the blended rate is determined, this percentage is applied to the Total Order Amount and calculated according to the vendor's billing currency.

A rate of 3.5% is applied regardless of the Total Order Amount on the AbeBooks.fr, AbeBooks.de, ZVAB.com, AbeBooks.it, or Iberlibro.com websites.

All orders are subject in each case to the following minimum payment service fee:

AbeBooks domain of purchase  

| AbeBooks domain of purchase | Minimum Payment Service Fee ($USD) |
| --- | --- |
| AbeBooks.com | $0.50 |
| AbeBooks.de | $0.90 |
| ZVAB.com | $0.90 |
| AbeBooks.it | $0.90 |
| AbeBooks.fr | $0.90 |
| IberLibro.com | $0.90 |
| AbeBooks.co.uk | $0.90 |

The payment service fees described above are refunded by Our External Payment Service Provider for any order that does not result in a sale.

3\. Statements
