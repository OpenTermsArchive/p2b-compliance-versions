You understand that we may modify or adapt your Content as it is distributed, syndicated, published, or broadcast by us and our partners and/or make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content to different media.

You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights, licenses, consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein for any Content that you submit, post or display on or through the Services. You agree that such Content will not contain material subject to copyright or other proprietary rights, unless you have necessary permission or are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant us the license described above.

You may need to create an account to use the Services. You are responsible for safeguarding your account, so use a strong password and limit its use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.

You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number.

### Your License to Use the Services

We give you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided on X, in the manner permitted by these Terms.

The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and other countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the X name or any of the X trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights. All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain our and our licensors' exclusive property.

You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, our computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of our providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by us (and only pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with us (NOTE: crawling or scraping the Services in any form, for any purpose without our prior written consent is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; (v) engage in any conduct that violates our [Platform Manipulation and Spam Policy](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation) or any other [Rules and Policies](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies); or (vi) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services. It is also a violation of these Terms to facilitate or assist others in violating these Terms, including by distributing products or services that enable or encourage violation of these Terms.

### Ending These Terms

You may end your legal agreement with us at any time by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. See [https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-x-account](https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-x-account) for instructions on how to deactivate your account and the Privacy Policy for more information on what happens to your information.

We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or [our Rules and Policies](https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies); (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct; (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: 2, 3, 5, 6, and the misuse provisions of Section 4 (“Misuse of the Services”). If you believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal following the steps found in our [Help Center](https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals) ([https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals](https://help.x.com/forms/account-access/appeals)). For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms survive the deactivation or termination of your account.

6\. General
-----------

We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at [x.com/tos](https://x.com/tos), will govern our relationship with you. Other than for changes addressing new functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify you 30 days in advance of making effective changes to these Terms that impact the rights or obligations of any party to these Terms, for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

To the extent permitted by law, you waive the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action or representative action proceeding.  
  
The X User Agreement is written in English but is made available in multiple languages through translations. X strives to make the translations as accurate as possible to the original English version. However, in case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the English language version of the X User Agreement shall take precedence. You acknowledge that English shall be the language of reference for interpreting and constructing the terms of the X User Agreement.

In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact [us](https://help.x.com/forms).
