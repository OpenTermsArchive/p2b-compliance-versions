Page 4 of 14

gaining agreements, local agreements, and general practices applicable from

time to time in relation to any Employment. Users acknowledge and accept

that Chabber ApS is not to be regarded as a party to any Employment and,

ic conditions, including salary, retirement and holiday pay, and the same facili-

ties and benefits as the permanent employees. It is noted that any form of

economical supplement, which is common practice for permanent employees

but not written down in the Employment Agreement, must also apply to the

Employee, so the Employee does not receive less pay than the permanent em-

ployees.

in accordance with Danish law's general rules. The documentation produced by

the Employer may not in any way derogate from these Terms and Conditions.

cordance with the provisions of the Employment Agreement. In any such

tice identical to the termination notice which the Employee must give pursuant

to applicable law or any relevant collective bargaining agreement, and (ii) noti-

fy Chabber ApS in writing hereof. If the Employer cancels an Employment

pervisory authority in relation to the Employee. Chabber ApS does not assume

any liability for the Employer’s actions, including any unlawful actions, faults

and omissions made by any Employee while performing his or her tasks with

an Employer. It is the responsibility of the Employer to ensure that the Em-

ployee is capable of performing the agreed work and that the Employee has

the necessary knowledge of material, machines etc. and any related safety

provisions.



4.10 It is the responsibility of the Employer to instruct the Employee to the extent

necessary in how to perform the tasks as well as informing the Employee of

any relevant internal rules and procedures in the business of the Employer.

in relation to time, place or nature of the tasks during an Employee’s perfor-

mance of his or her work, the Employee and Chabber ApS must be notified

thereof in writing without undue delay in the form of an updated Employment

Agreement. Any update must be done in accordance with clause 4.3. In the

event that the Employer does not notify the Employee and Chabber ApS in due

time, the Employer is liable to pay any loss or expenses incurred by the Em-

ployer, the Employee and/or Chabber ApS as a result of the amended em-

ployment conditions.

Employee are sound in terms of safety and health and that they comply with

applicable law, including the Danish Working Environment Act (in Danish: “ar-

bejdsmiljøloven”), the Danish Anti-Discrimination Act (in Danish: “diskrimina-

tionsloven”) and the Danish Equal Treatment Act (in Danish: “ligebehandlings-

loven”).

4.13 The Employer must ensure that the Employee is sufficiently insured, including

against third-party risks and occupational injury, pursuant to any law and col-

lective bargaining agreements applicable from time to time. If you book a

Chabber as a private person for a private event, the Chabber is covered by

Chabber ApS 'insurance in case of a damage / accident at the workplace.



4.14 In the event that after the termination of any Employment, the Employer

wishes to hire, on a permanent basis, any Employee who has worked for the

Employer within the past six months, the Employer may only do so with Chab-

ber ApS’ prior written consent. In this connection, the Employer must pay a

job provision fee to Chabber ApS of DKK 5,000. If the Employer hires an Em-

ployee with no prior written consent from Chabber ApS then the company will

be subject to a DKK 15,000 penalty, which shall be paid to Chabber ApS.
