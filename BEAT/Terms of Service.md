* “we”, “us”, “our” and “Company” refer to Free Now Hellas Single Member Societe Anonyme and its affiliate (distribution) partners
* “you”, “your”, “yours” and “Passenger(s)” refers to the customer using/booking a taxi through our mobile applications or through the website

###  **2. Scope of our Service**

Through the software, we provide an online platform through which taxi drivers appear online when available for booking, and through which you can make such bookings. BEAT provides you the opportunity to a) locate and contact drivers who are close to your location and b) choose amongst the available drivers c) request the provision of taxi services of your chosen driver. We are not a licensed private hire operator, nor a transportation carrier and we do not provide transportation services. We act solely as an intermediary between you and the taxi driver. From the point at which you make your booking through Free Now Hellas Single Member Societe Anonyme, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the taxi driver that you book. It is up to the Driver to offer transportation services which may be scheduled through use of the software or BEAT service. BEAT offers information and a method to obtain such taxi services, but does not intend to provide taxi services or act in any way as a transportation carrier, and has no responsibility or liability for any taxi services provided to you by such Drivers.

Each user remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the (descriptive) information displayed on our software. Our software does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level or rating of any user made available.

Our services are made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download or reproduce any content or information, software, products or services available on our software for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.
