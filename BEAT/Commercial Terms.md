These terms and conditions apply to all our services directly or indirectly (through distributors) made available online, through any mobile device, by email or by telephone. By accessing, browsing and using our website, our mobile application or any of our applications through whatever platform (hereafter collectively referred to as the “Software”) and/or by completing a booking, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions set out below (including the [privacy policy](https://thebeat.co/en/privacy-policy/?intl=1)).

The Software is owned, operated and provided by BEAT Mobility Services SINGLE MEMBER SOCIETE ANONYME and it is provided for your personal, non-commercial use only, subject to the terms and conditions set out below.

“Passenger(s)” refers to the customer using/booking a taxi through our mobile applications or through the website

“BEAT services” refers to services rendered by BEAT, through the use of its Software, to you

“Taxi services” refers to transportation services rendered by drivers to passengers

### **2\. The scope of our Service**

Through the software, we provide an online platform through which taxi drivers have the opportunity to receive transportation orders and the option to be contacted directly by potential passengers looking for a taxi through BEAT.

For this purpose, your identification details will be transmitted to the passengers every time the passenger searches for a taxi through BEAT. The passenger will be provided with your first name and surname, telephone number, photograph, your vehicle registration number, type of vehicle, location, languages spoken, acceptance rate, various services provided such as air-conditioning, mobile charger, accepting pets, passenger comments and number of assessments. As soon as you start the application and set yourself to ‘Available’ status, your location can be identified by all passengers and other users. The respective geo-information of the passenger will be specified after the passenger hails you through BEAT software.

We are not a licensed private hire operator, nor a transportation carrier and we do not provide transportation services. We act solely as an intermediary between you and the passenger. From the point at which you make you accept to transport a passenger through BEAT, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the passenger that has booked you. It is up to you to offer transportation services which may be scheduled through use of the software or BEAT service. BEAT offers information and a method to obtain passengers, but does not intend to provide taxi services or act in any way as a transportation carrier, and has no responsibility or liability for the passengers using BEAT.

When rendering our services, the information that we disclose is based on the information provided to us by the users. As such, the users are fully responsible for informing us with their updated information and indicate directly by themselves their availability, which is displayed on our software. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our BEAT services we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our software or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each user remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness, and correctness of the (descriptive) information displayed on our software. Our software does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level or rating of any user made available.

Our services are made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download or reproduce any content or information, software, products or services available on our software for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.

### 3\. Charges

Subject to the terms of this agreement, the driver shall pay to BEAT the amount declared in the driver’s section including all the legal charges (indicative: surcharge for pre-booked or immediate appointment, surcharge for each piece of luggage over 10 kg, surcharge to and from the airport etc.) of the respective country site for each ride that you book through the BEAT service as a fee for the use of BEAT services to you. The revenue achieved with the transport order obtained is immaterial.

Rides that you book through BEAT service will be calculated by the software system and totaled at the end of each month. You can access through your installed application at any time your balance that describes the total amount owed by you to BEAT, according to the above, regarding the rides that you book through BEAT service.

You shall have to make the payment of the services rendered the previous month, within the first ten (10) calendar days of each month. You accept that the relevant invoice can be sent to you by electronic means.

Any delay or failure to pay any invoice, for any reason, shall give the right to BEAT to increase the total amount due by you by default interest of 1% (one percent) per month. In these cases, BEAT may also in its sole discretion, suspend or cancel your access to the software.

The driver is responsible to bear any taxes, fees or charge levied on the payment of the above fee.

### **4\. Privacy**

BEAT uses high ethical standards and respects your privacy. Save for disclosures required by law in any relevant jurisdiction, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. However, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to our affiliated (group) companies (in and outside the European Union), including our and our affiliated (group) companies’ employees and our trusted agents and representatives who have access to this information with our permission and who need to know or have access to this information to perform our service (including customer services and internal (audit/compliance) investigation) to and for the benefit of you.
