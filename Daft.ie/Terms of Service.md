We accept no responsibility for the content of any business and/or advertising material, including, without limitation, any error, omission or inaccuracy.

Please note that the content of the published advertisements is provided by external users, and do not represent any views or opinions of Daft.ie, nor should they purport to do so.

Accordingly, we require that every care is taken by you or on your behalf in drafting the content of your advertisements in order to ensure that they are not in any way defamatory, illegal or in any other way harmful to a third party as you are solely responsible as author and publisher of your advertisement.

18\. Advertising terms and conditions
-------------------------------------

When creating an advertisement on the Website you must provide accurate, current and complete information and to promptly update the information that you provide to us when it changes.

Advertisements containing illegal, defamatory, obscene, indecent or otherwise offending material are not allowed on the Website. Duplicate advertisements are also prohibited.

We do not control the content of advertisements posted by users on the Website, and we do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of the content. You understand that by using the Website, you may be exposed to content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable without liability.

Using multiple addresses means that advertisements appear in the wrong category and search lists, making them inaccurate and therefore we do not allow the use of these in any form on the Website.

Daft.ie is a family website so we reserve the right to review and reject any advertisements that we feel have an adult theme. In particular no graphic images may be used in advertisements, any inappropriate content will be removed.

Advertisements which are posted and are found to be in breach of our policies will be removed without prior notification and no refund will be given. Users who are found to be in violation of our policies on more than one occasion may have their account removed and their information passed to the policing authority.

19\. Commercial Advertising
---------------------------

Businesses and persons acting in the course of trade are welcome to place classified advertisements on the Website.

Advertisements published by businesses or persons acting in the course of trade must comply with applicable laws and it is those persons' responsibility to do so. We will hold you responsible for any failure to comply with laws that apply to you or your content. You may need to adhere to the Consumer Protection Act 2007, the European Communities (Misleading and Comparative Marketing Communications) Regulations 2007, the European Communities (Misleading Advertising) Regulations 1988, European Communities (Protection of Consumers in Respect of Contracts made by means of Distance Communications) Regulations 2001, the European Communities (Directive 2001/31/EC) Regulations, 2003 (each as amended, supplemented or replaced from time to time) (the **"Ecommerce Regulations"**) and any other consumer protection legislation at the time being in force. Please note that the Website is aimed at consumers in Ireland (including Northern Ireland), but we cannot prevent you being contacted from other consumers or other third parties nor can we prevent your advertisement being displayed in other jurisdictions.

20\. Fair usage policy
----------------------

To ensure the best browsing experience for our users, your potential buyers, we ask that you only create one advertisement per property.

We only allow one property per advertisement. This ensures that your property will appear in the correct search and helps them sell/rent quicker. Your advertisement may be removed if:

a. you have more than one property in the listing;

b. you have multiple listings for one property across several sections; and/or

c. you have multiple listings for one property across several counties.

This will make it easier for a potential buyer/tenant to find your property. It will also make it easier for the advertisement to be removed when the property is no longer available. If this policy is not complied with, we reserve the right to remove the offending advertisement(s) from the Website without notice to you and without refund.

21\. Reporting breaches
-----------------------

Please use the 'Report this Ad' mechanism which we have placed on the Website to report any advertisement that is in breach of the User Agreement, illegal or in any other way objectionable.

22\. Standards
--------------

All advertisements must adhere to the ‘Code of Advertising Standards' of [The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland](http://www.asai.ie/) in addition to the standards set out in the Agreement.

23\. Responsibility
-------------------

You are solely responsible for the Content appearing in any of your advertisements and for the property sold or let following advertisement. We are not responsible for the properties appearing on the Website that you advertise or purchase or rent, nor are we responsible for the Content appearing in any of the advertisements. To the fullest extent permitted by law we disclaim any and all liability in respect of any arising from any reliance placed on the Content of any advertisement by any user of the Website or any claims arising in respect of any goods to which the Content relates.

24\. Consequences for failure to comply with the User Agreement
