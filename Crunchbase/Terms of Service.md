Terms of Service
================

****We’ve updated our governing terms to clarify your general release of us, clarify our right to seek injunctive and other equitable relief, clarify the categories of personal data we collect listed on our Privacy Policy, update the contact information listed on our GDPR Privacy Policy and elsewhere, revise our Data Use Addendum to reflect changes to applicable laws and update our Marketplace Terms of Service to reflect the data currently available in the Marketplace. The new Terms of Service went into effect on July 29th, 2022 and are listed below. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICE (DEFINED BELOW) IS SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE IN ANY MANNER.**** 

Last Updated: July 29th, 2022 

Welcome to Crunchbase. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our websites, products, services and applications (the “Service”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Service, please contact us at [policy@crunchbase.com](mailto:policy@crunchbase.com). 

These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Crunchbase, Inc. (“Crunchbase,” “we”, “our” and “us”). By using the Service in any way, you agree to and accept all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect at all times while you use the Service or any data obtained through the Service. These Terms govern your access to the Service and use of all data, content and other information on Crunchbase’s websites, applications, products and other properties and include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the [Crunchbase Marketplace Terms of Service](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/marketplace-partners/), [Attribution Instructions](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/attribution-instructions/), [Data Use Addendum](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/data-use-addendum/), [Apple Application Terms](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/apple-application-terms/), [Engagement Suite Terms](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/crunchbases-engagement-suite-terms/), [Copyright Dispute Policy](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/copyright-dispute-policy/), [Privacy Policy](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/privacy-policy/), [GDPR Privacy Policy](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/gdpr-privacy-policy/), and [Cancellation Policy](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/cancellation-policy/). 

**These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, a class action waiver and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.** 

**ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.** 

**Will these Terms ever change?** 

We are constantly trying to improve our Service, so these Terms may need to change along with the Service. We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the [Crunchbase website](https://www.crunchbase.com/), by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. 

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Service. If you use the Service in any way after a change to these Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes. 

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by you and Crunchbase. 

**What about my privacy?**

Crunchbase takes the privacy of its users very seriously.  For the current Crunchbase [Privacy Policy](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/privacy-policy/), please [click here](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/privacy-policy/). 

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 16; if you are a child under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Service or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [policy@crunchbase.com](mailto:policy@crunchbase.com). 

**What are the basics of using the Service?**

As part of using the Service you may be required to sign up for an account and select a password and email or user name (your “Crunchbase User ID”).  You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself.  You may not select as your Crunchbase User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. Your right to access the Service is personal to you and you may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission. You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password.  You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account. You will only use the Service and Content (defined below) in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Service is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Service. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your use of the Service in any way that breaks the law. 

You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Service and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity). 

****Your use of the Service is subject to the following additional restrictions:**** 

You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute or submit any User Submission (defined below) or other materials or otherwise use the Service or interact with the Service in a manner that:

(f) Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;

(j) Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content; or 

(k) Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Service. 

A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for account suspension or termination of your right to use or access the Service. 

****What are my rights with respect to the Service?****

You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Service in any way (including through the Crunchbase website, API, mobile applications, downloads, etc.). You will not use, copy, reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you in a way that violates someone else’s (including Crunchbase’s) rights.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may display insubstantial excerpts of Content for criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, research and similar purposes, provided: 

* The use does not compete with the Service; and

Any other uses of Content require Crunchbase’s prior written consent. 

You understand that Crunchbase owns the Service. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, re-sell, sublicense, re-distribute, or otherwise exploit any aspect of the Service.

You may be required to submit an application and/or meet certain eligibility criteria in order to participate in a program, and there may be different terms and conditions which apply to the specific program that you choose.

These Terms apply to all such programs unless specifically stated otherwise in the applicable program terms. 

Additionally, Crunchbase provides access to the [Crunchbase 2013 Snapshot](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/2013-snapshot) (the “Snapshot”) and [Crunchbase Open Data Map](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/open-data-map) (the “ODM”) pursuant to the following license terms: 

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you may access and use the Snapshot and the ODM pursuant to the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The Snapshot must be attributed to our designated pseudonym “CrunchBase 2013 Snapshot” and bear the copyright notice “© 2013” in accordance with the Creative Commons requirements. The pseudonym and copyright notice are meant to avoid confusion with the current Crunchbase dataset and to promote transparency to users of the data. If you have questions, please contact us at [policy@crunchbase.com](mailto:policy@crunchbase.com). 

****Do I have to grant any licenses to Crunchbase or to other users?**** 

Certain parts of the Service may allow you to integrate with other third-party accounts of yours, such as data from your productivity tools (e.g. CRMs, e-mail, sales engagement tools, etc.). If you choose to use these parts of the Service, you grant Crunchbase all licenses and rights necessary for Crunchbase to provide the Service to you, including a license for Crunchbase to read and write to your third-party account, to extract data from and upload data to your third-party account, and to share data extracted from your third-party account with other members of your team or institution, as further described in the next paragraph.   

Anything you post, upload, share, store, integrate with or otherwise provide through the Service is your “User Submission.” Some User Submissions (such as profile data you contribute to Crunchbase, or information you elect to share with other users through the Service, such as your team members) are viewable by other users.  For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Crunchbase a royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide license to translate, modify, aggregate, reproduce, display, distribute, and otherwise use and exploit such User Submissions for Crunchbase’s business purposes, including to provide, develop, and improve our products and services, except, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not permit Crunchbase to publish, display or distribute your data from your productivity tools (e.g. CRMs, e-mail, sales engagement tools, etc.) in a manner that is identifiable as originating from you without your written consent.  Please note that the foregoing license is subject to our [Privacy](https://about.crunchbase.com/docs/privacy-policy/) [](https://about.crunchbase.com/tos/pp/)[Policy](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/privacy-policy/) to the extent it relates to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information, and to our Data Use Addendum to the extent it relates to User Submissions that are the personally-identifiable information of another person. You are prohibited from including Social Security Numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport numbers, financial account and payment card information (except where expressly requested by Crunchbase), precise geolocation, and health and biometric information as part of any User Submission. 

****What if I see something on the Service that infringes my copyright?**** 

You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like Crunchbase, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to review our complete [Copyright Dispute Policy](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/copyright-dispute-policy/) and learn how to report potentially infringing content, [click here](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/copyright-dispute-policy/). To learn more about the DMCA, [click here](https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf). 

****Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Service?**** 

Any information or Content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Service is the sole responsibility of the person or organization from whom such Content originated. You access all such information and Content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or Content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Service. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact when using the Service and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Service. 

You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Service, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. Content includes, without limitation, personally identifiable information about you or any other person. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Service. 

Content that constitutes personally identifiable information may be subject to privacy laws or regulations, and your use of all such Content must at all times comply with the terms of our [Data Use Addendum](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/data-use-addendum/). You are solely responsible for understanding how privacy laws and regulations may impact your use of such Content and for ensuring that your use (including retention, storage, and all other forms of processing) complies with all such laws and regulations.  

The Service may contain content, data, links or connections to or from third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Crunchbase (“Third-Party Service(s)”). When you access or use Third-Party Services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Crunchbase is not responsible for such risks.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third-Party Service that you visit or utilize. 

One such Third-Party Service is FinancialContent Services, Inc. dba CloudQuote. Certain information available through the Service: (1) is proprietary to CloudQuote and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither CloudQuote nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 

Crunchbase has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any Third-Party Services or by any third-party that you interact with through the Service. In addition, Crunchbase will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any Third-Party Services. By using the Service, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your access to or use of any Third-Party Service. 

Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service, including payment and delivery of goods or services (if applicable), and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third-parties. You agree that Crunchbase shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. 

If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third-party, you agree that Crunchbase is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Crunchbase, its affiliates, and its and their directors, officers, agents, employees, partners, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Service. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” If you are not a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive any laws similar to California Civil Code Section 1542 which apply in your jurisdiction. 

**Will Crunchbase ever change the Service?**

We’re always trying to improve the Service, so it may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Service, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Service. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Service that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Service at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges that Content was contributed in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice. 

From time to time, Crunchbase may require you to expunge some or all of the Content in your possession, and you will do so promptly upon request. 

**Does using Crunchbase cost anything?**

We reserve the right to charge for certain parts or all of the Service. Certain aspects or uses of the Service require you to pay fees, for example, in order to access certain content or be able to download or export data. Visit [our products page](https://about.crunchbase.com/) for current descriptions of these services and the applicable fees. You agree to pay all fees which apply to your use of the Service. Crunchbase reserves the right to change any fees and pricing applicable to the Service at any time upon notice to you (which may be sent by email or posted on Crunchbase’s website). Your use of the Service following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased fees. 

**What if I want to stop using Crunchbase?**

You’re free to do that at any time; please refer to our [Cancellation Policy](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/cancellation-policy/) and [Privacy Policy](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/privacy-policy/), as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Service. 

Crunchbase is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Service or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. Crunchbase has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms. 

Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us. 

Additionally, upon termination of your account Crunchbase may require you to expunge some or all of the Content in your possession, and you will do so promptly. 

****I use the Crunchbase App available via the Apple App Store – should I know anything about that?**** 

These Terms apply to your use of all parts of the Service, including, without limitation the iPhone and iPad applications available via the Apple, Inc. App Store (the “Apple Application”), but [additional terms](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/apple-application-terms/) also apply to the Apple Application. 

**I use Crunchbase’s Engagement Suite – should I know anything about that?**

These Terms apply to your use of all parts of the Service, including, without limitation our Engagement Suite (“Engagement Suite”), but [additional terms](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/engagement-suite-terms/) also apply to our Engagement Suite. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Terms, Crunchbase’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements. 

**Additional Terms For Crunchbase Marketplace**

By accessing the [Marketplace](https://www.crunchbase.com/marketplace) feature on our Service, you acknowledge and agree that you have read and are bound to any additional third-party terms and conditions that apply to the content or data you access through the Marketplace. Without limiting the foregoing, a list of Crunchbase’s current Marketplace partners’ terms is provided on our [Crunchbase Marketplace Terms of Service](https://about.crunchbase.com/terms-of-service/marketplace-partners/) page. Please review those terms and conditions carefully prior to accessing any third-party data through the Marketplace.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

_Indemnity_. You agree to indemnify and hold Crunchbase, its affiliates, and its and their directors, officers, agents, employees, partners, and successors harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, penalties (including governmental fines), damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way relating to (a) your use of the Service (including any actions taken by a third-party using your account), or (b) your violation of these Terms. 

_Assignment_. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Service account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Crunchbase’s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent. 

_Choice of Law; Arbitration_. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms (whether brought against Crunchbase or against any director, officer or employee of Crunchbase in their personal capacity) shall be finally settled in San Francisco County, California, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, we shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of these Terms, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California. **Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CRUNCHBASE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.** 

_Third-Party Trademarks_. All third-party names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans (collectively, “Third-Party Trademark(s)”) contained in the Service are the property of their respective owners. Third-Party Trademarks are used by Crunchbase to refer to the owners of the Third-Party Trademark(s) in question and use by Crunchbase is not intended to (and does not) constitute or imply any kind of relationship between Crunchbase and the owners of the Third-Party Trademark(s) in question, including any affiliation, sponsorship, endorsement or approval of products and/or services, unless otherwise expressly indicated. 

_Safe Harbor Statement_. Any statements made by Crunchbase, oral or written, about new Service features or functionality are intended to outline Crunchbase’s general product direction for information purposes only and are not a commitment to deliver any material, applications, or functionality, and should not be relied upon. The development, release, and timing of any features or functionality remains at Crunchbase’s sole discretion. 

_Miscellaneous_. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Service, provided that Crunchbase may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Crunchbase agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Crunchbase, and that they supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Crunchbase, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Crunchbase in any respect whatsoever.
