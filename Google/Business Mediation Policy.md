Platform-to-Business (P2B) Mediation Help Centre
================================================

[P2B](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R1150&from=EN)is a European regulation that promotes fairness and transparency for EU business users of online intermediation services, also known as platforms. P2B also requires companies like Google that operate platforms to identify third-party mediators who might help facilitate the resolution of disputes when EU business customers raise concerns about those platforms. If you are a business user established or resident in the EU or the UK, it is highly likely that P2B is relevant to you.

Google platforms have existing customer support to respond to many business customer concerns specific to each platform. If you haven't yet tried out the help services applicable to the Google platform that you're using to request customer support, take a moment to do so. You may request troubleshooting to address your concerns.

If you have a complaint which you could not resolve through customer support and you are certain that you would like to consider requesting mediation, follow the steps below in this site.

Request mediation 
------------------

Mediation is a process where a trained neutral mediator actively assists people or organisations to work towards a dispute resolution. Before proceeding, you and Google would first need to agree to use mediation. Help us understand the issue that you would like addressed by submitting your concern via the online mediation request form. We'll review the request, determine if the product that your request refers to is within the scope of P2B and get back to you.

Please note that mediation entails a payment of a proportion of mediation fees as dictated by the process of the identified mediation institution.

**Mediator listing**

Google has identified the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution ('CEDR') as the institution which can provide mediation services through a panel of selected specialist mediators satisfying the requirements of P2B. The Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) works with impartial, independent and experienced commercial mediators throughout Europe and will administer the mediation according to the mediation rules for Google P2B disputes ('Mediation Rules'). You can see the relevant CEDR Mediation Rules online at [CEDR’s website](http://www.cedr.com/mediation/google).
