Request platform-to-business (P2B) mediation
============================================

[P2B](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R1150&from=EN)is a European regulation that promotes fairness and transparency for EU business users of online intermediation services, also known as platforms. P2B also requires companies like Google that operate platforms to identify third-party mediators who might help facilitate the resolution of disputes when EU business customers raise concerns about those platforms. If you are a business user established or resident in the EU or the UK, it is highly likely that P2B is relevant to you.

Google products have built-in customer support services that cater to many business customer concerns. Your best option is to engage with customer support. 

  
If, after engaging customer support, you still cannot resolve your complaint and you are certain that you would like to consider requesting mediation, follow the steps below.

What is mediation?
------------------

Mediation is a process where a trained neutral mediator actively assists people or organisations to resolve a dispute. 

Before proceeding, you and Google would first need to agree to use mediation. More details on the process can be found below.

Please note that mediation entails a payment of a proportion of mediation fees as dictated by the process of the identified mediation institution.

**Mediator listing**

Google has identified the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution ('CEDR') as the institution which can provide mediation services through a panel of selected specialist mediators satisfying the requirements of P2B. The Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) works with impartial, independent and experienced commercial mediators throughout Europe and will administer the mediation according to the mediation rules for Google P2B disputes ('Mediation Rules'). You can see the relevant CEDR Mediation Rules online at [CEDR’s website](http://www.cedr.com/mediation/google).
