9. RELATIONS BETWEEN PREPLY AND USERS



Providing the Services Preply is acting as an on-demand intermediary connecting Students and

Tutors and providing the tools to facilitate the tutoring services. You acknowledge and agree

that Preply is a technology services provider that does not provide online tutoring services or

functions as a language learning school.



Preply does not serve as an employer of any User unless separately subject to a signed, written

employment contract signed by both the User and Preply. Users may use the Services only for

the provision and receipt of the tutoring services subject to these Terms.



As such, Preply will not be liable for any tax or withholding, including but not limited to

unemployment insurance, employer’s liability, workers’ compensation insurance, social

security, or payroll withholding tax in connection with your use of Services. You are solely

responsible for adhering to all applicable tax regulations that may apply in connection with your

use of the Services. You hereby agree to compensate Preply for all state fees, claims, payments,

fines, or other tax liabilities that Preply will incur in connection with the obligations arising from

applicable tax or other regulations not being met by you.



In all cases of use of the Preply Platform, Users are acting as independent contractors and not

as Preply’s or any other party’s employee, agent, franchisee, or servant. Accordingly, you will

be solely responsible for all costs incurred by you or your organization. You may not act as an

employee, agent, or representative of Preply nor bind any contract on behalf of Preply. Where,

by implication of mandatory law or otherwise, you shall be deemed an employee of Preply, you

hereby agree to waive any claims against us that may arise as a result of a such implied

employment relationship. No User is entitled to participate in any Preply vacation, group

medical or life insurance, disability, profit sharing or retirement benefits, or any other fringe

benefits or benefit plans offered by Preply to its employees.



The Services provide connection to Tutors who are willing to be engaged by Students s as

independent contractors. As independent contractors, each Tutor decides when and how often

the Tutor will be available to provide the tutoring services to Students. Each Tutor controls the

methods, materials, content, and all aspects of the tutoring services. The Services allow Tutors

to create subject-specific tutoring services, for a certain number of hours.

Students are responsible for selecting the Tutor suitable for their learning goals. Students should

check each Tutor's self-reported credentials, education, and experience, as well as reviews from

other Students. Each Tutor has the sole discretion to accept or decline a request for the tutoring

services, as well as continue or discontinue a tutoring relationship with any Student.



Tutors may and, in fact are expected to perform the tutoring services for others or do other types

of work (either as an independent contractor or employee or other) while these Terms are in

effect, including with Preply’s competitors if desired, provided that such other activities do not

result in the Tutor’s violation of the Terms.



10. ASSIGNMENT



You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms in whole or in part

to any third party without Preply’s written consent. These Terms shall be binding and inure to

the benefit of the parties to these Terms and their respective successors, permitted transferees,

and assigns.



11. FEEDBACK



You acknowledge and agree that we may provide you with a mechanism to provide feedback,

suggestions, and ideas about the Services or the Preply Platform (the “Feedback”).



By submitting any Feedback, you provide us a written consent to use your Feedback for the

improvement and promotion of the Services. You agree that submitting a Feedback is gratuitous,

unsolicited, and without restriction and will not place us under any fiduciary or other obligation

and that we are free to use the Feedback without any additional compensation to you and/or to

disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.



You further acknowledge that, by accepting your Feedback, Preply does not waive any rights to

use similar or related ideas previously known to Preply, or developed by its employees, or

obtained from sources other than you. You agree that we may, in our sole discretion, use the

Feedback you provide to us in any way, including in future enhancement and modifications to

the Services. You hereby grant to us and our assigns a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable,

sublicensable, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative

works from, distribute, and display the Feedback in any manner for any purpose, or without it

in any media, software, or technology of any kind now existing or developed in the future,

without any obligation to provide attribution or compensation to you or any third party.



12. REVIEWS



You acknowledge and agree that Preply may calculate a composite rating based on comments

and reviews left by other Users s. Tutors agree to be rated by Students along several criteria, as

suggested by Preply. Preply provides its automatic feedback and rating system as a means

through which Users can express their opinions publicly, and Preply does not monitor or censor

these opinions or investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy or reliability unless a

User brings the posting to Preply's attention. You may be held legally responsible for damages

suffered by other Users or third parties as a result of these remarks if a court finds that these

remarks are legally actionable or defamatory. Preply is not legally responsible for any feedback

or comments posted or made available on the Preply Platform by any Users or third parties, even

if that information is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable. You agree to report violations

or abuses of our rating and feedback system immediately by contacting Customer Support.

relationship to, and are not plainly or grossly disproportionate to, the probable loss likely to be

for Preply and a User reaching an agreement as to such amounts was the uncertainty and cost of

litigation regarding the question of actual damages.

subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, agents, licensors, suppliers, other

Preply.

directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, employees, contractors, and any other third parties

related to the Services) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential)

of every kind, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way related with such disputes.



If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A

general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or

suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him

or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted in Delaware, USA, except that a User residing in

160 kilometers from the User’s residence. The individual arbitration must be before a single

arbitrator is conducted in English under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American

Arbitration Association (AAA).

either party.



The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration except (a) to the extent prohibited by

applicable law; (b) that if the arbitrator determines that costs unique to arbitration (i.e., filing,

administration, and arbitrator’s fees) would preclude a User from asserting a claim in arbitration,

the arbitrator may require Preply to pay a greater share of such costs unique to arbitration; and

(c) the prevailing party shall, to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, be entitled

to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with the arbitration in

such an amount as may be determined by the arbitrator.



All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and enforceable in any

court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding this, the application may be made to any court

for a judicial acceptance of the award or order of enforcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

from the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or any other court of competent

jurisdiction.
