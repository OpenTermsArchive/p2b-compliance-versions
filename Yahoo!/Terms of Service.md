Yahoo Terms of Service
======================

_In June 2017, we announced that Yahoo and AOL joined to become a unified digital and mobile media company. We are now operating under these unified Yahoo Terms of Service. If you have a Yahoo or an AOL account, you will need to agree to these Terms. (Note, if you have not yet agreed to these Terms, the [legacy Yahoo Terms of Service](https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/directory/registration/index.htm?redirect=no) or [legacy Oath Terms of Service](https://legal.aol.com/legacy/terms-of-service/full-terms/index.html) (for AOL) still apply to your account.) For all Yahoo products or services that are accessed without signing into an account, the Terms below apply to those products and services effective May 25, 2018. If you are creating a new account, the Terms below apply starting today._

**Yahoo Terms of Service**

    2. _Access to Your Account._ You are responsible for all activity that happens on or through your account. To protect your account, keep your password confidential. Do not reuse your account password with other services.

    3. _Notices._ Yahoo may provide you with notices, including service announcements and notices regarding changes to these Terms, by, but not limited to, email, regular mail, text message or SMS, MMS, push notification or in-app message, postings on the Services, telephone, or other reasonable means now known or hereafter developed. You consent to receive these notices by any and all of the foregoing means. You may not receive notices if you violate the Terms by accessing the Services in an unauthorized manner, and you will be deemed to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the Services in an authorized manner.

    Our [privacy policy](https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.html) describes who we are, what information we collect from you, how we process your information, who we share it with, and your rights under data protection laws.
    
5. **Procedure for Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringement Claims**  
      
    We respect the intellectual property of others, and we expect our users to do the same. We may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, disable, terminate, and/or take other appropriate steps relating to the accounts of users who may be infringers. If you believe that your copyright or intellectual property rights have been infringed, please follow the instructions provided [here](https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/ip/index.html).
    
6. **Content in the Services and License Grant to Yahoo** 
    
    1. _Content_. Our Services display some content that we did not create and do not own. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity or person that makes it available. We assume no responsibility for the conduct of third parties, including persons or entities with which you communicate using the Services. Many of the Services enable you to submit content. You – not Yahoo – are entirely responsible for any content that you upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available via the Services. We may remove and refuse to display content that violates the Terms or applicable laws or regulations, but that does not mean that we monitor the Services or review or screen any content. By using or accessing the Services you understand and agree that you may be exposed to offensive, indecent, or objectionable content.
        
    2. _IP Ownership and License Grant_. Except as otherwise provided in the specific product terms or guidelines for one of our Services, when you upload, share with or submit content to the Services you retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content and you grant to us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to (a) use, host, store, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works (such as translations, adaptations, summaries or other changes), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute this content in any manner, mode of delivery or media now known or developed in the future; and (b) permit other users to access, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, prepare derivative works of, and publicly perform your content via the Services, as may be permitted by the functionality of those Services (e.g., for users to re-blog, re-post or download your content). In some of the Services, there may be specific terms or settings allowing a different scope of use of the content submitted in those Services. You must have the necessary rights to grant us the license described in this Section 6(b) for any content that you upload, share with or submit to the Services.

11. **Fee-Based Services and Billing.** Unless otherwise specified in the additional terms that apply to the Services you are using, the terms in this Section 11 apply to you.
    
    1. We offer products and subscriptions for a fee (“fee-based Services”). These fee-based Services are governed by the additional terms you agree to when you register for the fee-based Service and these Terms. If you register for a fee-based Service, you must designate a payment method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information and you have the continuing obligation to keep it up to date. Many fee-based Services require you to have, or register for, a Yahoo or AOL ID. If you are an AOL Dial-Up customer, please see additional terms by clicking [here](https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/additional/dial/index.html).
        
    2. The following important provisions apply to all of our fee-based services:
        
        1. Third-Party products. If the fee-based Service includes a third-party product, you understand and agree that your purchase and use of the Service is also subject to the third party’s terms of service and privacy policy, which you should read thoroughly before agreeing to them.
            
        2. Payments. You represent that you are at least the minimum age required to enter into a legal agreement. You agree to pay us for any fee-based Services you purchase from us, as well as all other charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes and fees. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account, including purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account or any sub-or linked accounts (including any person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your authentication credentials.
            
        3. Payment Methods. You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if it fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us, even if we received it in association with other fee-based services. You are responsible for all charges even if your payment method fails or is denied. You authorize and direct us to retain all information about any payment method(s) associated with your account. We may import payment information you entered during a prior purchase and provide you the option to use that payment information during purchase of a new product. You permit us to obtain and use updated information from the issuer of your payment method in accordance with the policies and procedures of any applicable card brands. We may in some instances continue charging a payment method past its expiration date at our discretion and subject to the payment processors' or issuing bank's approval. Surcharges may apply if you use certain payment methods, such as payment from your checking or savings account.
            
        4. Payment Terms. We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump sum, or other basis in accordance with the stated terms, as long as your subscription remains active, even if you have not downloaded or used the Service or accessed your online account.
            
        5. Auto-Renewal. We use auto-renewal for many of our fee-based Services. At the expiration of each subscription term for such fee-based Services, we will automatically renew your subscription and charge the credit card or other payment method you have provided to us, unless you cancel your subscription at least 48 hours before the end of the current period. Unless otherwise stated in Section 14, your subscription will be automatically renewed at the then-current price, excluding promotional and discount pricing. We may, in our sole discretion, post charges to your payment method individually or aggregate charges for some or all of your fee-based Services with us.
            
        6. Fraud Protection. We may take steps to verify the validity of the credit card information you provide to us, including debiting amounts less than $1.00 from your credit card and then immediately crediting it back. You authorize us to do so for verification and anti-fraud purposes.
            
        7. Free Trials. We may offer you free trials, so that you may try a fee-based Service subscription without charge or obligation ("Free Trial"). Unless otherwise stated and unless you cancel your subscription prior to the expiration of the Free Trial, periodic subscription fees will be charged at the then-applicable rate upon expiration of the Free Trial period and will continue to be charged until the subscription is canceled. If you are not satisfied with a particular fee-based Service, you must cancel the subscription before the Free Trial ends to avoid charges. We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials or other promotional offers.
            
        8. No Refunds. All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise in the terms you agree to when you register for a fee-based Service, unless stated differently for your country in Section 14 or as otherwise specified below.
            
        9. Termination. We, in our sole discretion, may change, discontinue or terminate any or all aspects of a fee-based Service without notice, including access to support services, content and other products or services ancillary to the fee-based Service, subject to providing an appropriate refund for any portions of a specified but no longer available term. You may cancel a fee-based Service at any time by logging into your online account and terminating the subscription.
            
        10. Change in Fees and Billing Method. We may change our fees and billing methods at any time. We will provide you with notice of any price increase at least thirty (30) days in advance. Subject to applicable law, (i) if you disagree with any proposed change, your sole remedy is to cancel your fee-based Service before the price change takes effect and (ii) your continued use of or subscription to the Service after the price change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the new price for the Service.
            
        11. Delinquency. After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment. You are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you.
            
        12. 90-Day Notice Period. You must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your billing method statement. If you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.
            
12. **About these Terms**
    
    1. _Third Party Beneficiaries and Conflicts_. These Terms control the relationship between you and us. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights. If there is a conflict or inconsistency between the terms in this document and the additional terms associated with a particular Service, the additional terms will control solely for that conflict or inconsistency.
        
    2. _Modification of the Terms_. Unless stated differently for your country in Section 14, we may modify the Terms from time to time. Unless we indicate otherwise, modifications will be effective as of the date they are posted on this page or any successor page. You should look at the Terms regularly. We will provide notice (in accordance with Section 3(c) above) of material modifications.
        
    3. _Continued Use of the Services_. You may stop using the Services at any time, but your continued use of or subscription to a Service after the effective date of any modifications to the Terms means that you agree to the Terms as modified.
        
    4. _Waiver and Severability of Terms_. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision (or part of a provision) of these Terms is found to be invalid, you and we nevertheless agree to give effect to the intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.
        
    5. _Assignment by_ _Us_. We may freely assign these Terms and all of the policies and other documents incorporated or referenced in it (including all rights, licenses, and obligations under it or them), in whole or in part and without notice, for any reason, including for the purpose of internal restructuring (for example, mergers or liquidations).

            1. Where we modify the Services as outlined in Section 7(a), or we modify these Terms pursuant to Section 12(b), we will tell you a reasonable amount of time in advance of any modifications that will materially disadvantage our users or materially limit the access or usage of Services. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any such modifications means that you agree to the Services or the Terms as modified.
                
            2. For modifications to the Terms or to the Services that we need to make to meet security, safety, legal or regulatory requirements, we may not be able to notify you in advance but we will let you know as soon as practicable.
                
        7. _Notice of cancellation, suspension or limitation of the Services or your account._
            
            1. Despite Subsection (f) above and without prejudice to your statutory rights, we may, without notice, temporarily or permanently suspend or cancel your account or impose limits on or restrict your access to parts or all of your account or the Services:
                
                1. if you violate, or we believe you are about to violate, the Terms, including any incorporated agreements, policies or guidelines;
                    
                2. in response to requests by law enforcement or other government agencies under valid legal process;
                    
                3. due to unexpected technical or security issues or problems; or
                    
                4. if your account shows extended periods of inactivity in accordance with our account deletion policy.
                    
        8. If we permanently suspend or terminate your account, we will notify you in advance and allow you reasonable time to access and save information, files, and content associated with your account unless we have reason to believe that continued access to your account will violate applicable legal provisions, requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, or cause damage to us or to third parties.
            
        9. _Cooling off period for EU consumers._ The following provisions supplement Section 11 (Fee-Based Services and Billing).
            
            1. If you are a consumer living in the EU, you can cancel your fee-based Service without giving a reason within 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract. You can notify us by completing and submitting this [form](https://login.yahoo.com/?.done=https%3A%2F%2Fio.help.yahoo.com%2Fcontact%2Findex%3Fpage%3Dcontactform%26locale%3Den_GB%26token%3DZh%252FBBVqXzLHlIbokbUqVWTUbuuQeXGkGgS3%252B4Rh5kxWAQXYZ547z%252B5LnIKLv8bEck3A0sV5mhjMquLxPTzbwFlxIPTI4PGo%252FbDbodxUliozOIP1RXs9thxait2y%252FhZGV%252FbCJV8mes9owO1ZuEuGGcw%253D%253D%26selectedChannel%3Demail-icon&.src=yhelp&.intl=uk) or if you have no other option, by returning [this form](https://legal.yahoo.com/uk/en/yahoo/terms/otos/paid/services/cancellation/form/index.html) to us by post. You must send your notification to us before expiry of the 14-day cancellation period.
                
            2. Exceptions. If you purchase digital content not supplied in a tangible medium from us you agree that the cancellation period expires immediately once you begin to download or stream the digital content.
                
            3. Reimbursement. We will reimburse all payments received from you for the fee-based Service no later than 14 days from the day on which we received your cancellation notification. Unless you expressly agree otherwise, we will use the same means of payment as used for the initial transaction. You agree that if you start using the fee-based Service before the end of the cancellation period you will be liable for all charges incurred up to the date of cancellation.
                
        10. _Auto-Renewal._ In addition to Section 11(b)(v), the following shall apply: If your subscription is auto-renewed and the price has increased, you will be notified of the applicable new price and you will be allowed to terminate your subscription within a period of 14 days upon receipt of the notice. In such case the new price will not become effective and your subscription will end at the end of the term.
            
        11. _Exclusions and Limitations of Liability._ Nothing in the Terms affects any legal rights that you are entitled to as a consumer under Irish and EU law which cannot be contractually altered or waived. Accordingly, some of the exclusions and limitations in Sections 8 and 9 of the Terms will not apply to you if you are a consumer living in a European Union country.
            
        12. _Our Liability._ Despite Section 9, we accept responsibility for fraudulent representations made by us or if you are injured or die as a direct result of our negligence in connection with the Services.

            1. Restrictions on use of Yahoo Services.
                
                The EU Digital Services Act requires us to inform users in the European Union that we impose certain restrictions on user-provided content that is hosted on Yahoo sites, including moderating user comments. We also enable users to report and request the removal of illegal content. We follow Yahoo’s internal policies and procedures, including where appropriate human review, to identify illegal content. Where necessary, pursuant to our [community guidelines](https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/guidelines/index.html), we take action to remove that content.
