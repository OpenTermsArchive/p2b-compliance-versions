The Fee may be paid using PayPal, via text messaging on your phone, or with a credit or debit card. If you choose to pay using PayPal, you will be brought to the PayPal website, [https://www.paypal.com/ie](https://www.paypal.com/ie), and you will be subject to PayPal’s policies, including their user agreement and [privacy policy](https://hello.donedeal.ie/hc/en-us/articles/201251721-Privacy-Policy).

You may save your PayPal and/or credit and debit card details for future payments on the Website.

You may also pay the Fee using your phone. If you choose this option you will receive a text message with a code to activate your advertisement. When you enter the code and your advertisement is published. Your account credit is then charged the Fee with no additional network charges. For further information on paying using your phone, please see [hello.donedeal.ie/pay-using-your-phone](https://hello.donedeal.ie/hc/en-us/articles/201252051-Ways-to-pay).

Once your advertisement is posted on the Website your request for our services cannot be cancelled at that stage. Prior to the advertisement appearing on the Website you may cancel the advertisement by [contacting us](https://hello.donedeal.ie/hc/en-us/requests/new).

**17\. Published advertisements and duration of advertisements**

Once you have completed the process of submitting your advertisement we will send you an email confirming receipt of your order for the DoneDeal Service, this email does not constitute an acceptance of your order. Your order for posting an advertisement on the Website will not be accepted and an agreement concluded between us and you in relation to the publication of the advertisement on the Website until the payment for the DoneDeal Service has been received by us.

Advertisements will be displayed for a period of two months on the Website once initially posted. If you wish to extend this period you will be required to resubmit your request for the DoneDeal Service and to make a further payment for those services.

Content which comprises advertising material will appear on the Website. Individual advertisers are solely responsible for the content of the material which they submit to us including ensuring that it complies with relevant legislation. We accept no responsibility for the content of any business and/or advertising material, including, without limitation, any error, omission or inaccuracy.

Please note that the content of the published advertisements is provided by external users, and do not represent any views or opinions of DoneDeal.ie, nor should they purport to do so.

Accordingly, we require that every care is taken by you or on your behalf in drafting the content of your advertisements in order to ensure that they are not in any way defamatory, illegal or in any other way harmful to a third party as you are solely responsible as author and publisher of your advertisement.

**18\. Advertising terms and conditions**

When creating an advertisement on the Website you must provide accurate, current and complete information and commit to promptly update the information that you provide to us when it changes.

Advertisements containing illegal, defamatory, obscene, indecent or otherwise offending material are not allowed on the Website. Duplicate advertisements are also prohibited.

We do not control the content of advertisements posted by users on the Website, and we do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of the content. You understand that by using the Website, you may be exposed to content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable without liability.

Using multiple brand names/search words means that advertisements appear in the wrong category and search lists, making them inaccurate and therefore we do not allow the use of these in any form on the Website.

Donedeal.ie is a family website so we reserve the right to review and reject any advertisements that we feel have an adult theme. In particular, no graphic images may be used in advertisements and any inappropriate content will be removed.

Advertisement for the sale of any substance or product deemed a ‘controlled drug’ within the following legislation (each as amended, supplemented or replaced from time to time) or whose sale is otherwise restricted by law is also not permitted on the Website:

_Access to Data_

Business Users have access to personal and other data through their use of the DoneDeal platform and are required to comply with all applicable laws (including Data Protection Law) in their processing of this data.  Information provided or generated by you during the course of your contractual relationship with DoneDeal (such as details of users or statistics or copies of your correspondence with other users) will not be available once your account or access to our Website is terminated.   We retain any personal data of our Business Users for a period of time in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://hello.donedeal.ie/hc/en-us/articles/201251721-Privacy-Policy).

_Termination_

If your account or access to our Website is terminated in accordance with Clause 12, you will have the opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances leading to your suspension or termination within the framework of our internal complaint-handling process, as described in more detail below.

In turn, you may terminate this agreement at any time (subject to satisfaction of the relevant minimum notice period) by sending us an email or by deleting your account.

_Complaints Handling and Mediation_

We aim to treat all Business Users in a fair and transparent manner.  We have a designated internal-complaint-handling system available to Business Users with complaints relating to the following:

* DoneDeal’s alleged non-compliance with any obligations in the Platform to Business Regulation, which affects the Business User lodging the complaint;
* Technological issues which relate directly to the provision of our services and which affect the Business User; and
* Measures taken by or behaviour of DoneDeal which relates directly to the provision of our services and affects the Business User.

The internal complaint-handling process begins by Business Users submitting a complaint to the following email address [p2bcomplaints@donedeal.ie](mailto:p2bcomplaints@donedeal.ie).  The process then proceeds as follows:

1. You will receive an automated acknowledgement of your email once your complaint is received. A designated case officer within DoneDeal will be assigned to your complaint and will make initial contact with you within 3 working days.  Depending on the nature of the complaint alleged, the case officer may request additional supporting documents to assess your complaint.
2. The case officer will review and carefully consider all information provided, including whether you have complied with the DoneDeal Terms of Use and Policies. Where the complaint relates to a restriction, suspension or termination by DoneDeal, you will be given the opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances leading to the restriction, suspension or termination.
3. Following a comprehensive review of the information provided, the case officer will communicate his/her preliminary decision to you 15 business days after receipt of all requested information. You will be provided with an opportunity to review and provide your comments on the preliminary decision.
4. We will consider any feedback and then proceed to issue a final decision in relation to your complaint.

We endeavour to handle and settle disputes and complaints in an amicable manner internally.  However, our mediation service is available to Business Users who have exhausted the above process and are unhappy with the final outcome.  These mediation services are available at:

**20\. Fair usage policy**

To ensure the best browsing experience for our users, your potential buyers, we ask that you only create one advertisement per item/product.

We only allow one item/product per advertisement. This ensures that your products appear in the correct search and helps them sell quicker. Your advertisement may be removed if:

* you have more than one item/product in the listing;
* you have multiple listings for one item/product across several sections; and/or
* you have multiple listings for one item/product across several counties.

This will make it easier for a potential buyer to find the item you wish to sell. It will also make it easier for the advertisement to be removed when the item is sold. If this policy is not complied with, we reserve the right to remove the offending advertisement(s) from the Website without notice to you and without refund.

In the case of dealer subscription accounts, DoneDeal reserves the right to suspend Dealerships that consistently remove ads and relist them in order to improve their rank in search listings. DoneDeal’s Bump or Spotlight Products should be used to promote a dealership’s stock.

**21\. Reporting breaches**

Please use the ‘Report this Ad’ mechanism which we have placed on the Website to report any advertisement that is in breach of the User Agreement, illegal or in any other way objectionable.

**22\. Standards**

All advertisements must adhere to the ‘Code of Advertising Standards’ of [The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland](http://www.asai.ie/) in addition to the standards set out in the Agreement.

**23\. Responsibility**

You are solely responsible for the Content appearing in any of your advertisements and for the goods sold following advertisement. We are not responsible for the goods appearing on the Website that you advertise or purchase, nor are we responsible for the Content appearing in any of the advertisements. To the fullest extent permitted by law we disclaim any and all liability in respect of any claim arising from any reliance placed on the Content of any advertisement by any user of the Website or any claims arising in respect of any goods to which the Content relates.
