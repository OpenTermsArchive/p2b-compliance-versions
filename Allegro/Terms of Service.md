Section 3. OFFERS



3.1.



On Allegro, the Seller, when setting the offer terms, may make available to Buyers the following

procedures for entering into the sale agreement:



a. Only with Buy Now option, where the Seller offers to sell the Goods at a predetermined price. This

Offer may include one or more units of the Goods;



b. Auction, where the Seller, by putting up the Goods for sale, invites Bidders to place bids in order to

conclude an agreement. Auction may involve only one unit of the Goods. In the case of Auction, the

Seller may set additionally the Buy Now option; however, if the Seller sets a reserve price on the terms

set out in paragraph 3.2., the Buyer may use the Buy Now option only until the Bidder places a bid equal

to that price. If no reserve price is set by the Seller, the Buyer may use the Buy Now option until the

Bidder places the first bid.



3.2.



In Auction, the Seller may set a reserve price, i.e. the lowest price at which the Seller is willing to sell the

Goods. Bids lower than the reserve price shall not result in the conclusion of the sale agreement. The

amount of the reserve price shall not be disclosed to Users until a Bidder offers the price equal to or

higher than the reserve price.

The aim of the Offers displayed in the listing categories: “Cars”, “Real Estate”, “Holidays”, “Live Animals”,

“Machinery”, “Trailers, Semitrailers”, “Other Vehicles and Boats”, “Motorcycles and Quads”, “Services” and

“Tickets” is not to conclude an agreement. These Offers are only classified ads. The Offers referred to in

The Offers referred to in this paragraph may be presented by entities cooperating with Allegro.pl under

separate agreements, in particular, on websites or in online applications (including mobile applications)

operated by them.



3.4.



Allegro.pl uses default sorting of Offers within the list of Offers, to adjust the order of their placement

to the preferences of Buyers (“Relevance”).



The following factors are taken into account with respect to Relevance:

number of displays of the Offer in different time intervals; the number of purchases made in a specific

6.10.



Appendix No. 3 hereto sets forth an action plan for scheduled technical breaks and technical failures, in

Section 7. AGREEMENT CONCLUDED AS PART OF THE OFFER



7.1.



Allegro.pl is not a party to any Goods sale agreements made between Users and does not ensure that

the Sellers and the Buyers are authorized to enter into and perform such agreements. Where a User

concludes an agreement with another User that has its registered office or habitual residence outside

Poland, this might result in the Transaction being covered by the provisions of foreign law.



7.2.



An agreement shall be concluded with the winner of the Auction. The winner of the Auction shall be the

User who, upon its closure, offered the highest price for the Goods and their bid was at least equal to

the reserve price if such a price was specified by the Seller (accepting the winning bid). If several Bidders

placed bids indicating the same highest price, the Bidder who bid as the first offering the highest price

shall become the winner.



7.3.



The Buyer shall enter into an agreement with the Seller, confirming the purchase using the “Buy and

Pay” button, or a similar one, subject to paragraph 3.3. Each purchase and some payment methods may

7.4.



The confirmation of entering into an agreement between the Buyer and the Seller shall be sent

automatically by email (or alternatively by other means of electronic communication) and shall be for

information purposes only. In the email referred to in the previous sentence, the parties to the

agreement shall receive the data currently appearing in their Account settings, i.e. Ask the Seller, email

address (encrypted by Allegro.pl), contact number, address. In the event when the Seller’s registered

office as set in the Account settings is outside the European Economic Area or the Offer has been marked

in the “Delivery details” field as “Non-EAN Offer”, the data referred to in the previous sentence will be

sent outside the European Economic Area. If the Buyer selects a shipping method as part of which the

shipped item is assigned a tracking number, information regarding shipment tracking may be made

available to Allegro.pl directly by the carrier or the Seller if the number of the parcel is made available in

the “Purchased” tab displayed after logging in to the Account, the Buyer shall be sent an additional email

message with the carrier’s name, shipment tracking number and a link to track the shipment.

b. within 14 days in the case of Offers with the Buy Now option for which the Buyer has chosen payment

with a traditional bank transfer,



c. within 30 days in the case of Auctions.



The Buyer’s failure to pay for the Goods in a timely manner and, - in the case of an Auction, - the

additional transaction rebate granted to the Seller, will result in Allegro.pl automatically canceling the

Transaction (except for the “OTC drugs” category). If the conditions for automatic cancellation of

Auctions described above are not met within 30 days, Allegro.pl reserves the right to reassess. The

abovementioned actions of Allegro.pl have no impact on the civil-law effects of the sale contract

concluded between the Users and does not release them from the obligation to render performances

towards each other under the legal relation arisen.

Section 6. Settlements



A. Settlements of amounts payable

26-74-798, REGON 365331553



1. For each User, settlements for the full scope of services related to ensuring functionality and services

available on the Allegro commercial platform (the “Comprehensive Service”) are separate for each

Account type. The Comprehensive Service does not cover services and settlements referred to in Section

5, item 1e or settlements which are not VAT-taxable (“NoVAT Settlements”) referred to in Section 8.



2. Settlement data may be managed upon logging in to the Account; from their Account, each User may

view their current and past settlement and transaction reports (that state the fees and sales

commissions charged, and the refund amounts, i.e., the settlement balance). Such settlements include

a detailed calculation of partial fees that make up the total fee for the Comprehensive Service and the

No-VAT Settlements, as referred to in Section 8.



3. Users are obliged to pay all amounts due to Allegro.pl until the fourteenth day of the next month.



4. Users who receive invoices are obliged to pay the amount payable indicated in the invoice irrespective

of its amount.



5\. A User that does not receive any invoices is obliged to pay the fees due to Allegro.pl after the end of

a given billing cycle. It is not required to make any payment in case the total amount due as of the end

of a month is below PLN 10.00. In such case, the User shall make a payment after the end of the month

in which the amount due reaches at least PLN 10.00. However, upon the request of Allegro.pl, the User

shall be obliged to make a payment within a specific deadline even if the total balance is below

PLN 10.00.



6. Failure to pay the amount payable within the required time limit may result in the User Account

functionality being partially or completely disabled. In such a case, the restoration of full Account

functionality shall be conditional on the settlement of all amounts payable to Allegro.pl.



7. Payments to the Allegro.pl shall be made to an individual bank account assigned to a given Account.

Payment details are available upon logging in to the Account.



8\. Payments made by Users to Allegro.pl are credited towards the amounts arising from an invoice that

is due and payable. When it comes to the Users referred to in section 5 above, such payments are

credited for the monthly settlement of a given billing cycle. With respect to a single billing cycle,

payments made by Users are credited on a pro-rata basis to the Comprehensive Service and No-VAT

Settlements. In case the fee due to Allegro.pl is made up of several due and payable invoices or monthly

settlements of billing cycles, payments made by Users are credited first towards the oldest of them.



B. Overpayments



1. If an overpayment is made to the Account during a billing cycle, the User may, at any time, request a

refund, using a form available in the My Allegro \> Billing \> Settlements with Allegro tab, save that the

overpayment in the Account shall be first credited towards any fees and sales commissions currently

charged, and No-VAT Settlements, and any debts in a given User’s other Accounts. As a general rule, the

overpayment shall be refunded by bank transfer to the entity that made the payment, to the account

from which the payment was made.

2. In case of any overpayment in the Account at the end of a billing cycle, it will be recognized as an

advance towards the Comprehensive Service (excl. No-VAT Settlements referred to in Section 8) in

subsequent billing cycles. If the User does not want the overpayment to be credited as an advance, they

should ask for its refund in accordance with the applicable procedure.



3\. In case the advance referred to in section 2 above is available in the User Account, it will be applied in

the following order: (a) to cover the adjustment of payments made (taking into account any payments

made in a given month), if such adjustment occurs in a given month; (b) to cover the fees and charges

(excl. No-VAT Settlements). If there are no fees and charges in a given billing cycle (excl. No-VAT

Settlements, as referred to in Section 8), or their total amount is below the overpayment for prior billing

cycles (minus adjustments of payments made in the current cycle), and at the same time there are any

No-VAT Settlements, the User expresses the intention to change the purpose of the advance, and to

apply the funds from the overpayment for No-VAT Settlements (at the amount corresponding to the

value of No-VAT Settlements or the overpayment value).



4\. Debits arising from fees and commission charged in a given month for the Comprehensive Service

and No-VAT Settlements shall be first set off by Allegro.pl against the advance(s) referred to in sections

2 and 3 above, resulting from prior billing cycles. Then, Allegro.pl will clear the advances against the

payment made or overpayment emerging in the current billing cycle. In such a case, the provisions of

section 1 above shall apply accordingly.



5\. The funds obtained by the User from promotional actions organised by Allgro.pl are non-refundable

and can only be used in total for the payment of future fees arising from the services performed for the

User as part of Allegro.



C. Changes in the amounts of fees and sales commissions



1. Allegro.pl reserves the right to change the amounts of fees and sales commissions. These changes

shall be made following the procedure and on the terms set out in the Terms \& Conditions.



2. Allegro.pl reserves the right to reduce fees and sales commissions, from time to time, as part of time-

limited special offers — on the terms separately provided for such campaigns.



D. Invoices and notes



1. Business Account Users, to receive invoices, should fill in a relevant form and have their data as

provided in the invoicing form verified as true. Invoicing data must correspond to the data provided in

the Account settings. Invoices for subsequent invoices shall be issued automatically without the need to

repeat the actions indicated in the previous sentences — until the User opts out of receiving invoices.



2. Invoices for Users who are natural persons not pursuing an economic activity shall be issued solely

upon their request. In such a case, the provisions of subparagraph 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis.



3. A. A User who is a tax on goods and services (VAT) payer, having a registered address within a

European Union Member State other than Poland, is obliged to produce documents to certify its

registration as a taxpayer in one of the European Union Member States other than Poland, and fill in a

B. Users with their registered seat outside Poland, who have a fixed establishment in Poland, as defined

in Article 11 section 1 of Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 282/2011, should notify this fact to

Allegro.pl, indicating their Polish VAT number. Such notification should be effective starting from the

billing cycle during which it is submitted. Submission of such notification will have an impact on the VAT

rate applicable to the fees and commissions for the services related to the Transaction, performed as

part of Allegro.



4. Invoices for a given month include amounts payable charged in this month, and they are issued no

later than on the 15th day of the next month.



5. The User is obliged to update invoicing data immediately following any change. As regards updates to

invoicing data (except for address and telephone data), such change is possible only if the company has

undergone a transformation or its form of legal succession changed. A change shall be made once

documents to certify legal succession are verified as true. The change takes effect starting from the first

invoice issued after positive verification of data.



6. A default procedure for sending invoices is making them available in electronic form. By accepting the

Terms \& Conditions, an acceptance is also given for sending (making available) invoices in electronic

form, as defined in the applicable regulations on goods and services tax, on the terms described in the

Terms \& Conditions.



7. To ensure the authenticity of invoices as defined in separate regulations, invoices shall be made

available to the User in electronic form solely upon logging into his/her Account, using login and

password, in a manner to enable downloading them to the User’s IT system.



8. To ensure the integrity of invoices as defined in separate regulations, the invoices made available in

electronic form shall be generated as PDF (Portable Document Format) files, secured to prevent any

change to the invoice data, in particular:



a. document editing,



b. inserting comments,



c. filling in or signing form fields,



d. document assembly,



e. copying the document contents,



f. extracting pages.



9. Allegro.pl reserves the right to use other technical solutions in addition to those indicated in

subparagraphs 7 and 8 above, aimed to ensure authenticity and integrity of invoices sent (made

available) in electronic form.

10. The User may, at any time, withdraw the consent to having invoices sent (made available) in

electronic form, by checking the relevant box in the administrative dashboard in the User’s Account. The

following shall also be deemed a withdrawal of the consent to having invoices sent (made available) in

electronic form:



a. The User opting out of receiving VAT invoices, upon logging into his/her Account (closing the invoice

b. Any Party declaring to terminate the Agreement.



11. The User who has withdrawn the consent to having invoices sent (made available) in electronic form

may give their consent again by checking the relevant box in their Account’s settings.



12. Consent to having invoices sent (made available) in electronic form, as well as a withdrawal of the

consent, shall have immediate effect.



13. The User who receives VAT invoices sent (made available) in electronic form is obliged to store them

in accordance with separate regulations.



14. Allegro.pl reserves the right to issue and send to the User a hard copy invoice, even if the User

consented to have invoices sent (made available) in electronic form.



15. Invoices sent (made available) to the User in electronic form shall be available in the User account

administrative dashboard for 7 years of the date of issue. Consequently, no copies of electronic invoices

are issued.



16\. “In minus” amended invoices with VAT are issued by Allegro.pl as part of the approval of conditions

for reduction of the taxation base, as referred to in Article 29a section 13 of the Goods and Services Tax

Act, expressed through the User’s acceptance of the Terms \& Conditions.



17\. If only No-VAT Settlements are subject to documenting in a given settlement period, instead of an

invoice, Allegro.pl shall issue to the User an accounting note.



Section 7. The procedure for granting transaction rebate (in connection with

sales commission collected or charged)



1. In particularly justified cases, where the Seller has concluded a sale agreement and the Transaction

did not violate the Terms \& Conditions, Allegro.pl may grant a transaction rebate to the Seller in the

current billing cycle for the supply of services on.



2. A transactional discount is granted in accordance with the rules specified below, depending on the

payment method selected by the Buyer:

maintained for the Seller in a different payment institution which has been indicated by the User as

relevant for payouts,



b. invalid or incorrect data necessary to process a payment order,



c. as a result of a notice or decision of a competent authority,

1.5. PayPro shall complete payment orders of the Buyers referred to in Article 1.2. under an agreement

on a single payment transaction within the meaning of the Act. Specific principles concerning the

completion of payment orders of Buyers are provided for in Article 6 hereof.



1.5a. PayPro shall complete payment orders of the Sales Commission Payers referred to in paragraph

1.2a. under an agreement on a single payment transaction within the meaning of the Act. Specific

principles concerning the completion of payment orders of Sales Commission Payers are provided for

in paragraph 6a hereof.



1.6. The Framework Agreement between PayPro and the Seller shall be concluded upon the following

conditions being met jointly: approval of the Terms \& Conditions of Przelewy24 Service, (where such

approval is given by accepting the Allegro Terms \& Conditions) and, where such choice is possible,

selection of the nature of the relation under the Framework Agreement, as described below in

connection with the first configuration of the Allegro Account after the conclusion by the Seller with

Allegro.pl of the agreement on the provision of services on Allegro on the terms provided for in the

Allegro Terms \& Conditions. If, in connection with the first configuration of the Allegro Account, no option

to choose the relation nature is offered, the Framework Agreement shall be concluded upon the

moment when the first of the aforesaid conditions is met.



1.6a. Once an Allegro Account is set up, with its first configuration, prior to listing the first offer, the Seller

running a business shall choose the nature of the relation under the Framework Agreement (unless the

case referred to in paragraph 1.6d or 1.6e occurs), i.e., whether the Framework Agreement is intended

to be permanent from the very beginning or it is not intended to be permanent, as per the criteria

specified by PayPro, which means that in the latter case the use of the payment services and making

payment transactions will be only occasional. The above-mentioned choice of the relation nature made

by the Seller as part of the Allegro Account configuration prior to listing the first Offer shall result in

PayPro performing, as the case may be:



a) “Full verification”, i.e., the Identification and Verification procedure referred to in paragraph 3.5c (for

a permanent relation), or



b) “Simple verification”, i.e., the Identification and Verification procedure referred to in paragraph 3.5a

(for an occasional relation).



The relevant option is chosen when the User chooses the button with the word “Choose” or a similar

one, and once it is clicked, the choice may not be changed. Buttons with the word “Next” or a similar

one, which appear while making choice, do not determine the final relation choice, because after clicking

on them and before clicking on the button with the word “Choose” or a similar one, the User may still

return to the previous steps of the relation choice.



1.6b. The Seller who chose an occasional relation when concluding the Framework Agreement may, after

the conclusion of the Framework Agreement and regardless of the further provisions, change the

relation nature for permanent, which entails the need to complete the supplementary Identification and

26-74-798, REGON 365331553



Verification procedure referred to in paragraph 3.5d, unless this procedure has already been applied.

The relation nature shall be changed with the use of the Account features, and the provisions of

paragraph 1.6a regarding the labeling of the buttons used for the choice apply accordingly to such

selection. Furthermore, the provision of information and documents required by the Operator as part

of the supplementary procedure to the Operator by the Seller may take place also before the Seller

expresses their intent to change the relation from occasional to permanent.



1.6c. The Seller who chose a permanent relation when concluding the Framework Agreement may not

change the relation nature to occasional after the conclusion of the Framework Agreement.

Furthermore, if the Seller previously changed the relation from occasional to permanent, they may not

change it again to occasional relation.



1.6d. If the Seller sets up another Account on the Allegro Platform, the Seller shall have no option to

specify the nature of the relation under the Framework Agreement and the relation shall have the same

nature as a relation determined and existing for an Account or Accounts set up previously. If the buttons

allowing to choose the relation are displayed again to the Seller when configuring another new Account,

the Seller should choose the same relation as the one binding on them for the Accounts set up

previously, and should the Seller choose a different relation, then:



a) if the previous relation is occasional, the choice of a permanent relation shall be deemed the change

referred to in paragraph 1.6b with regard to all related Accounts referred to in paragraph 1.6e;



b) if the previous relation is permanent, the choice of an occasional relation shall be ineffective as per

paragraph 1.6c, and the relation shall remain permanent.



1.6e. For a Seller with more than one Account on the Allegro Platform, the nature of the relation between

the Seller and the Operator shall be the same for all the Accounts and related Framework Agreements.

In case of change of the relation nature from occasional to permanent for one Account, the change shall

apply to all the other Accounts and Framework Agreements.



1.6f. For specific categories of Sellers, during the first configuration of the Allegro Account and

conclusion of the Framework Agreement, the option to choose the relation nature may be blocked, and

in this case, the Seller must undergo the full Identification and Verification procedure and the relation

shall be deemed permanent.



1.6g. Within the term of the Framework Agreement with an occasional nature, the Seller may

occasionally use the payment services and in a fashion that does not show signs of permanence. In

collaboration with Allegro, the Operator shall analyze the Seller’s use of the payment services on a

current basis to determine whether the relation nature has not changed from occasional to permanent.

In particular, the Operator may change the relation status from occasional to permanent, where:



a) the quantity of payment transactions handled for the Seller, for all the Seller’s Accounts, implies that

the use of the payment services is not occasional; the Operator makes the assessment individually on a

case-by-case basis in this regard;

26-74-798, REGON 365331553



b) the total value of payment transactions handled for the Seller, for all the Seller’s Accounts, implies

that the use of the payment services is not occasional; the Operator makes the assessment individually

on a case-by-case basis in this regard;



c) other circumstances of using the payment services by the Seller, for any of the Seller’s Accounts on

the Platform and any of the Seller’s Framework Agreements, imply that the relation nature is not

occasional; the Operator makes the assessment individually on a case-by-case basis in this regard.



1.6h. If the Operator changes the relation status to permanent as the result of the analysis referred to

in paragraph 1.6g, the Seller shall be notified thereof directly by the Operator or through Allegro, and:



a) until the end of the supplementary Identification and Verification procedure referred to in paragraph

3.5d, the Seller may not use the payment services within the extent of withdrawing funds paid by the

Buyers after the change;



b) furthermore, if despite a request, the Seller fails to complete the supplementary Identification and

Verification procedure within the time limit set by the Operator, the Operator may, after the lapse of the

time limit, decide to suspend the Seller’s option to use the payment services also within the extent of

accepting funds from the Buyers.



1.6i. The Seller may not question the Operator’s assessment regarding the change of the relation status

referred to above, as the change entails specific obligations of the Operator resulting from the provisions

of the Act on Counteracting Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.



1.6j. For the purpose of the above provisions, the Accounts on the Platform kept for the same Seller shall

be deemed to be the Accounts for which the Seller’s details imply that the payment services provided

under the Framework Agreement are going to be provided to the same entity or the same entity is the

beneficiary of the withdrawals linked to such Accounts. This is the case, in particular, where several tax

identification numbers (NIP) or several numbers of the accounts referred to in paragraph 5.3 linked to

such Accounts are identical.

made available to Users on Allegro.

shall be available to Users.

Agreement concluded with PayPro.



1.12. Users shall not be required to open a bank account to be able to use Przelewy24 Service, and any

Description of the Payout Withholding qualification procedure



5.12. The qualification of Sellers’ Accounts for Payout Withholding in the cases referred to in

subparagraphs 5.10 a)–d) shall be made on each first Wednesday of the month; however, if this day is a

public holiday, the qualification shall be made on the next working day. Subsequent qualifications of a

given Seller who has already been qualified to the group of the Sellers whose Transactions involve a

higher risk level shall be made in three-month intervals, counting each time from the date of the

previous qualification for Payout Withholding, until the moment when, in the subsequent qualification

process, it is determined that the Seller no longer meets the Payout Withholding criteria. Being qualified

again for the Payout Withholding has no effect on how long it will be applied to respective Transactions.

This period is fixed, one-off, and described in paragraph 5.13.

5.13. Payout Withholding may be applied for the following period:



a. in the case of the Sellers qualified to the group of the Sellers referred to in paragraph 8.9.a of the

10.16. The role of Allegro.pl is limited to providing Users with a tool enabling them to create Fundraisers

on the terms set out in the Terms \& Conditions. Users have full discretion in respect of their decision to

support a specific Fundraiser. Before making a decision to support a Fundraiser, the User should always

carefully read all the information regarding the Fundraiser. Users make decisions to support Fundraisers

at their own risk and responsibility.



10.17. Allegro.pl is not responsible for the actions or omissions of Fundraiser organizers, who act

independently of Allegro.pl when creating Fundraisers. Verification by Allegro.pl is limited to making

sure that the Fundraiser satisfies the formal requirements set out in the Terms \& Conditions.

Furthermore, Allegro.pl does not guarantee that a Fundraiser will be successful.



10.18. If the User decides to support a Fundraiser on the terms set out in the Terms \& Conditions, this

shall be tantamount to entrusting funds intended for the Fundraiser to the entity that runs the

Fundraiser in order for the funds to be donated to the selected Fundraiser based on the instruction from

the User who supports the Fundraiser and on the terms set out in the Terms \& Conditions.



10.19. From the moment a Fundraiser is created, PayU S.A. will maintain a settlement tool for the entity

that runs the Fundraiser, on which funds donated to the Fundraiser will be collected. The entity that has

created a Fundraiser and that has been entrusted by Users with funds for the Fundraiser shall allocate

the funds exclusively to Fundraisers, as instructed by Users, which shall only be done through the Allegro

Lokalnie functionality designed for Fundraisers. The funds collected on the settlement tool will be

distributed in accordance with the Users’ instructions with no need for the entity that has set up the

Fundraiser to take any action. The entity creating the Fundraiser gives the consent referred to in this

paragraph 10.19 when creating the Fundraiser.



10.20. Given the adopted technical solutions and the temporary allocation of the funds to the settlement

tool of the User organizing the Fundraiser, there is a risk that the funds deposited in that settlement tool

may be seized by enforcement authorities as part of enforcement proceedings instituted against the

User. When organizing a Fundraiser, the User represents that no enforcement proceedings are pending

against them and that there are no impediments or circumstances which could threaten the correct

organization and running of the Fundraiser, including the funds raised as part thereof. Where the funds

have been lost for reasons attributable to the User, the User shall commit to reimbursing Allegro.pl for

them without undue delay.



10.21. Where a Fundraiser features an image, the User represents and warrants that they are authorized

to use the image and that they have obtained any required third party consents to use the said image,

and that the use thereof as part of the Fundraiser will not infringe any third-party rights. The image must

be linked with the purpose of a given Fundraiser and it may not contain any illegal or offensive content

or content contrary to the generally applicable customs and standards of social conduct. Allegro.pl

reserves the right to remove the images which, in the company’s opinion, violate the provisions of this

paragraph 10.21.

1.1.



E-commerce VAT — VAT collected and paid by Allegro.pl for Transactions made by Sellers as part of the

obligations imposed under the e-commerce VAT Package;



1.2.

and Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011 (as implemented by Council Implementing

Regulation (EU) 2018/1912 and Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2026) and to the Polish VAT

Act imposing obligations on e-commerce platforms in the case of B2C Transactions, in particular

regarding (i) the collection and payment of VAT in specific cases and (ii) the archiving and reporting of

transactions.



1.3.

in terms of human and technical resources to enable an entity that does not have any registered seat in

a specific EU country to carry out business activity in it. In particular, its establishment is not determined

particular country.



Section 2. Introduction



2.1.



Appendix No. 20 of the Allegro Terms \& Conditions provides the terms and conditions for Sellers

regarding the applicability of the e-commerce VAT Package on Allegro, which, under the EU VAT

Directive, as part of B2C Transactions, imposes on e-commerce platforms, including Allegro, the

obligation to settle VAT or to process, archive, and report transactional data.



2.2.



Due to the applicability of the e-commerce VAT Package, Allegro.pl shall be assigned the taxpayer status,

i.e., it is obliged to collect and pay VAT for B2C Transactions made on Allegro, when the following

conditions are met jointly:



a. VAT Goods are delivered by Sellers with registered seats outside the European Union (who, at the

same time, do not have a Fixed Establishment in the territory of the European Union) and



b. VAT Goods are delivered in the territory of the European Union.



(Example 1: Allegro.pl will be required to collect and pay e-commerce VAT on a Transaction made between a

Seller with its registered seat in China, who does not have any Fixed Establishment in any European Union

country, and the Buyer from Poland who is a consumer, if the item on the Offer at the time of purchase is in a

warehouse in Germany and, as a result of the Transaction, it will be shipped from Germany to Poland.)



(Example 2: Allegro.pl will not be required to collect and pay e-commerce VAT on a Transaction made between

a Seller with its registered seat in China, who has a Fixed Establishment in the Netherlands (and is registered

there for VAT EU purposes), and the Buyer from Poland who is a consumer, if the item on the Offer at the time

of purchase is in a warehouse in the Netherlands and, as a result of the Transaction, it will be shipped from

the Netherlands to Poland.)

Within the scope of paragraph 2.2. and in other cases, under B2C Transactions covered by e-commerce

VAT, Allegro.pl shall process, including archiving, transaction data referred to in paragraph 3.1. below

and make them available to competent tax authorities upon their request.



2.4.



At the same time, Allegro.pl reserves that, despite the provisions contained in this Appendix of the

Allegro Terms \& Conditions related to the obligations of Allegro.pl concerning VAT settlements under

the e-commerce VAT Package and the archiving of information on specific Transactions, the role of

Allegro.pl referred to in Section 8. of the Allegro Terms \& Conditions and the Seller’s obligations resulting

therefrom, including those related to the completion of Transactions, shall not change.



CHAPTER 2. TRANSACTIONS



Section 3. Sellers’ Liability



3.1.



Allegro.pl shall settle VAT for Transactions subject to e-commerce VAT and process, including keeping

records of these Transactions, based on the information provided by the Seller. For this purpose, the

Seller shall provide the required and accurate data and information, update them promptly, and make

factual statements.



3.2.



The scope of data and information referred to in paragraph 3.1. and provided by the Seller shall refer

to the time of the B2C Transaction and include, but not be limited to:



a. the Goods being sold in the Offer and other parameters and information contained in the Offer

description, required to determine the obligation to settle e-commerce VAT, including those regarding

the change in the price of the Goods sold, cancellation of payment, reimbursement of the payment to

the Buyer, return of the Goods by the Buyer;



b. the country of the Seller’s registered seat;



c. the fact of having or not having any Fixed Establishment in the territory of the European Union and

an EU VAT number assigned to the Seller in the country where they declare to have a Fixed

Establishment, in the case of Sellers with their registered seats outside the European Union;



d. the country where the Goods are stored at the time of their sale understood as the country from

which the Goods purchased are to be dispatched (in accordance with the Seller’s declaration at the time

At the same time, for each Offer, the Seller will be able to optionally specify additional settlement or

reporting parameters under the e-commerce VAT Package. In particular, when listing an Offer, the Seller

will be able to declare the VAT rate applicable in Poland for the Goods sold and, if justified, the basis for

excluding it from VAT or e-commerce VAT, and whether the item(s) sold in the Offer are VAT Goods or

services within the meaning of the VAT Act. In the absence of the aforementioned declaration, the Goods

sold in the Offer shall be assigned the status of VAT Goods and the basic VAT rate applicable in Poland.

In the case of B2C Transactions, which, in accordance with the e-commerce VAT principles, are taxed in

a country other than Poland, the Goods sold in the Offer shall be assigned the basic VAT rate applicable

in the specific region of the European Union being the country of the delivery of the Goods as specified

by the Buyer.



A Seller outside the European Union who has a Fixed Establishment in the territory of the European

Union should submit an appropriate declaration and provide a valid VAT EU number assigned to them

in the country in which they declare having their Fixed Establishment.



3.3.



Allegro.pl reserves that each change of any information or data referred to in paragraph 3.2. above

made by the Seller within an Account shall be taken into account from the first B2C Transaction to be

carried out after the Seller changes such data.In particular, as a rule, their retrospective application to

the already completed B2C Transactions shall not be possible. However, in the case of declaring a Fixed

Establishment, the declaration shall be considered made with full force and effect upon the positive

verification of the VAT number assigned to the Seller in the country in which they declare having the

Fixed Establishment.



3.4.



The information or data referred to in paragraph 3.2. above provided by Sellers may be monitored or

verified by Allegro.pl using internal controls or by tax authorities, including Polish or foreign customs

authorities, as part of appropriate control procedures.



3.5.



Allegro.pl reserves that in the event of any doubts as to the true nature or accuracy of the data referred

to in paragraph 3.2. above, it may take measures in accordance with paragraph 8.2. of the Terms \&

Conditions, i.e., refuse to publish the Offer, terminate the Offer early, or remove the Offer with Buy Now

option or remove the Auction.



3.6.



The price of the VAT Goods specified in the Offer by the Seller must be indicated in its gross amount,

i.e., including any VAT. If Allegro collects e-commerce VAT as part of the B2C Transaction being carried

out, the amount transferred to the Seller for the sales of the VAT Goods under the Offer shall be reduced

by the value of the calculated e-commerce VAT.

(Example 1: If a Transaction is subject to e-commerce VAT, then if the price of the item in the Offer is PLN 123

and it is subject to 23% VAT, Allegro.pl will collect and pay PLN 23 to the tax authority, and the Seller will

effectively receive PLN 100).



(Example 2: If in relation to the same Offer referred to in Example 1 above, the Transaction is not subject to e-

commerce VAT, i.e., if in the same circumstances, the purchase would be made by a Buyer who is not a

consumer (e.g., a limited liability company), then Allegro.pl will not collect VAT and the Seller will effectively

receive PLN 123).



Section 4. Settlements



4.1.



By accepting this Appendix, the Seller hereby authorizes Allegro.pl to order the Payment Operator,

referred to in Appendix 7A and Appendix 7B of the Allegro Terms \& Conditions, to pay from the funds

booked in the Seller’s settlement tool any amounts due for Transactions qualified as subject to e-

commerce VAT settlement by Allegro.pl within the shortest time frame possible following a relevant tax-

triggering event. The authorization shall also provide for the right to process data for this purpose. The

collected amount shall each time correspond to the current e-commerce VAT amounts due. The Seller

may not claim a refund in that respect within the meaning of Articles 47 and 48 of the Act on Payment

Services of 19 August 2011, subject to paragraphs 4.5.–4.8. below. If the Seller withdraws the

authorization referred to in the preceding sentence, any re-authorization shall be granted exclusively

through the re-acceptance of this Appendix and the Allegro Terms \& Conditions.



4.2.



As per tax regulations, Allegro.pl shall transfer the amount of VAT collected by Allegro.pl for Transactions

classified as subject to e-commerce VAT settlement to competent tax authorities.



4.3.



E-commerce VAT settlements shall be included in the Seller’s current balance by making an appropriate

billing entry by Allegro.pl in a separate tab in the Seller’s Account, and then properly documented in the

invoice issued by Allegro.pl.



4.4.



The Seller shall be charged VAT, and Allegro.pl shall collect its amount for Transactions classified as

subject to e-commerce VAT settlement when the tax obligation arises for Allegro.pl, i.e., at the time when

the Buyer accepts the payment related to the Seller’s particular B2C Transaction, i.e., respectively:



a) when the Buyer clicks the “Buy and Pay” button next to the Buy Now option,

and

b) in the case of an Auction, upon clicking the “Pay” button and providing the delivery address by the

Buyer, but no later than within 7 days; however, in the absence of the declaration concerning the delivery

country for the Auction within the time-limit specified above, Poland shall be considered the delivery

country for the Goods. If, after 7 days, the delivery country other than Poland is provided, Allegro.pl shall

correct e-commerce VAT settlements at the Seller’s request.



4.5.



If the Seller makes a full or partial refund of the payment to the Buyer for the Goods purchased in a B2C

Transaction for any reason (e.g., due to a complaint or withdrawal from the agreement without providing

a reason), the Seller shall refund the gross amount to the Buyer under the B2C Transaction carried out

(i.e., including the amount of e-commerce VAT collected).



4.6.



In the event when the refunds referred to in paragraph 4.5. above are made through the tools available

on Allegro the refund of the e-commerce VAT collected by Allegro.pl shall be made automatically in an

appropriate and proportional amount to the Seller’s settlement tool on Allegro. If the said refunds are

made by the Seller outside the tools available on Allegro (e.g., directly between the Seller’s and the

Buyer’s bank accounts), the refund of the e-commerce VAT collected by Allegro.pl shall be made only

upon the request made by the Seller to Allegro.pl.



4.7.



In the event when the Buyer cancels a B2C Transaction (withdraws from the agreement) until the time

when payment is assigned the “Payment complete” status, the e-commerce VAT correction in the Seller’s

settlement tool shall be made automatically. In the event when the Buyer cancels a B2C Transaction

later, the refund of the e-commerce VAT collected by Allegro.pl shall be made only upon the request

made by the Seller to Allegro.pl.



4.8.



In the event of circumstances related to the handling of B2C Transactions other than those described in

paragraphs 4.5.–4.7. above, in particular, events related to the modification of an order by the Seller or

the Buyer affecting the amount of VAT (e.g., order surcharge, combining payments, or editing orders),

Allegro.pl reserves the right to reclassify the Transactions as part of e-commerce VAT, as a result of

which the related charges for the Seller may be corrected. Provisions of paragraph 4.3. above shall apply

accordingly.



4.9.



For e-commerce VAT settlements made by Allegro.pl, each order in a B2C Transaction shall be

understood as:



a. a single parcel if, for a particular order, as per the Seller’s declaration, the delivery of the Goods is to

be made only from the territory of the European Union or only from outside the territory of the

European Union;

b. separate parcels if, for a particular order, as per the Seller’s declaration, the delivery of the Goods is

to be made jointly from the territory of the European Union and from outside the territory of the

European Union.



(Example: If, as part of an order from the same Seller, the Buyer has ordered two items of Goods, and the first

item is located in and is to be dispatched from a warehouse in the USA and the second item is located in and

is to be dispatched from a warehouse in the Netherlands, Allegro.pl will assume that, as a result of the order,
