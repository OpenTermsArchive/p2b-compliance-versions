IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH SNAP INC., THEN YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

Introduction
------------

These Business Services Terms form a legally binding contract between Snap and the individual agreeing to these Business Services Terms and any entity on whose behalf that individual is acting (“you”) and govern the use of Snap’s business products and services (“Business Services”). These Business Services Terms incorporate by reference the [Snap Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/) and Supplemental Terms and Policies. The Business Services are “Services” as defined in the [Snap Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms).

1\. Contracting Entity; Accounts
--------------------------------

a. The Snap entity you contract with depends on where you live (for an individual) or where your entity’s principal place of business is located. For an individual using the Business Services in her or his personal capacity, “Snap” means Snap Inc. if the individual lives in the United States and Snap Group Limited if the individual lives outside the United States. If the individual is using the Business Services on behalf of an entity, then “Snap” means Snap Inc. if that entity’s principal place of business is in the United States and Snap Group Limited if that entity’s principal place of business is outside the United States, in each case, even if that entity is acting as agent for another entity somewhere else. However, if the [Local Terms](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/local) specify a different entity based on the specific Business Services you are using, then “Snap” means the entity specified in the [Local Terms](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/local).

b. You may be required to create and maintain an account and sub-accounts to use the Business Services. You are responsible for setting and revoking the access levels for your accounts, for providing and updating any information that Snap reasonably requests, and for all activity that occurs in your accounts. If you are authorized to access a third-party account, you must comply with these Business Services Terms when you access that party’s account.

2\. Restrictions
----------------

a. In addition to the restrictions under the [Snap Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms), you will not, and will not authorize, encourage, or allow any other party to: (i) use or combine the Services with software offered under an open-source license that creates obligations with respect to the Services contrary to these Business Services Terms, or purports to grant to any third party any rights to, or immunities under, Snap’s intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Services; (ii) gather, access, or otherwise process any personal data via the Services for any purpose without Snap’s prior written consent; (iii) transmit any "back door,” “time bomb,” “Trojan Horse,” “worm,” “drop dead device,” “virus,” “spyware,” or “malware,” or any computer code or software routine, which permits unauthorized access to, disables, damages, erases, disrupts, or impairs the normal operation of, or use of the Services, or any products or services provided by a third party in connection with the Services; or (iv) sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, license, sublicense, syndicate, lend, or provide access to (except to individuals you authorize to access and use your accounts) the Services, without Snap’s express prior written approval.
