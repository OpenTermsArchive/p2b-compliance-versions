#### I'm a student, how can I pay?

You can book a free 15 minutes lesson or pay for a complete lesson. Said payment will be made to CLASSGAP by credit card, PayPal or any other payment method enabled in your country.

If you are a holder of a debit/credit card, you can choose "Save card for future transactions" to avoid having to re-enter your details on.

The data will be collected by the Classgap encrypted form and sent to Braintree, which handles elcetronic payment transactions externally.

Braintree, will store and treat such details independently.

It's compulsory to pay the price of any confirmed reservation and authorize the charge of the corresponding amount to your PayPal account or to charge the amount to your credit card. Once confirmed that the reservation has been completed, you will receive a confirmation email.

Remember that these payment methods can require that you remain subject to its terms and conditions, which are different from the ones in CLASSGAP.

Thereby, CLASSGAP will receive from the student the complete price of the lesson and later will later deliver it to the tutor, once deducting all applicable fees (CLASSGAP fee and, if applicable, from PayPal, bank, etc).

Thus, CLASSGAP acts as mere intermediary in this payment reception, not being responsible for the contract between the tutor and student. The tutor will be responsible for the quality of the classes as well as the student’s billing. CLASSGAP will not be responsible for the non-payment of the price of the lessons nor its refund. In this regard, it should be noted that, unless stipulated differently in other manner in this document, the price of the class will not be refundable.

#### I'm a tutor, what's the service fee?

Tutors will be who state the price of their lessons. In case a class is done, CLASSGAP will obtain a percentage of the sale price. Such percentage will vary depending on the booking is directly done through the tutor or through CLASSGAP's website and/or one of their affiliates:

1.  Through the Tutor: CLASSGAP will obtain a percentage of 10% of the price set by the tutor when the booking comes from their own channels, through a link provided to that effect.
2.  Through CLASSGAP or our affiliates: CLASSGAP will obtain a variable percentage depending on how many teaching hours the tutor has taught using CLASSGAP. Find below how it works:  
      
    
    |     |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Tutor | **New**  <br>up to 50 hours | **Professional**  <br>between 51 and 250 h. | **Star**  <br>more than 250 h.\* |
    | Comission | 20% | 15% | 13% |
    
      
    Unlike the New and Professional teachers whose commissions depend on number of lessons they've globally taught on Classgap, the Star teachers should teach a minimum of 250 lessons every year to maintain their commission.  
    The total amount after applying the percentage should be higher than 1,25€. Otherwise, a minimum fee of 1,25€ per hour will be applied.  
      
    All of the above given percentages **include all the services offered by Classgap**, including:  
      
    1\. Student acquisition.  
    2\. Student payment costs by: credit or debit card, Paypal...  
    3\. Virtual classroom with all the available features.  
    4\. Tutor payment costs: bank transfer or Paypal each month.

We reserve the right to modify at any time the service fees (or to start charging for free services) with the condition that such changes do not have retroactive character to the fees paid before the date of the change.

#### I'm a tutor, how and when will I receive my earnings?

At the end of each month we will analyze how much you have earned. There are two posible scenarios:

1.  You have earned more than 50 euros: We will transfer your earnings at no cost by bank transfer (for CEE bank accounts) or Paypal.  
    
2.  You have earned less than 50 euros: In this case we will keep your earnings until you reach this threshold.
3.  According to the [visibility level you chose](https://www.classgap.com/my/tutor/profile?tab=6), your profile will be more or less visible and other commissions will apply to the first class with each student.

This duality in the payment method is aimed for all the parts to save costs. Thus, if the tutor lives outside Spain the field to be filled out in CLASSGAP is the one for the PayPal account.

The tutor must be autonomous (freelance) and fulfill the obligations with IRS (generally it must bill with the IVA tax). However, CLASSGAP is not responsible for controlling the fulfillment of said obligations.

#### Tutoring hour packages

Optionally, teachers may offer lower prices for class hours if the student contracts packages of hours in advance.

Packages will be a minimum of 5 hours, and must be spent in 1 hour classes. All packages are valid for 6 months and are valid only with the selected teacher. Once the pack has expired, the tutor and the student will not be able to recover the amount of these classes.

Once one or more classes of a package have been completed, no refunds will be made, except in those cases in which the teacher certifies that he or she cannot continue teaching.

#### Free class 15 minutes

Optionally tutors can offer students a 15 minute class. Students can book without any cost a 15 minute class to those tutors that have this option.

*   You can book up to 3 free classes per student.
*   A maximum of 1 free book with the same tutor.

Teachers who want to offer a free 15 minute class must have Classgap APP installed on your device.

#### What is my visibility level as a tutor ?

Your profile visibility in the teachers grid depends on a several factors :

*   The visibility level you have selected from your personal area
*   The quality of your profile, as in the number of classes you have given on Classgap, the time it takes you to reply to messages or to accept a booking and the conversion rate from free interviews to chargeable classes
*   Your availabilities at that time. You will not appear the days you have marked as absent from your personal area

#### Refund by complaints regarding quality of the lesson:

When can a student ask for a full refund?

1.  When the class has not been done due to the abscence of the tutor.
2.  When the class is cancelled for any reason at least 8 hours before the scheduled time of the class.
3.  Within 24 hours after the class, when it’s your first class at Classgap and you feel unsatisfied.

To ask for a full refund due to dissatisfaction, please send an email to support@classgap.com with your reasons and your personal information (name, surname, phone number and a copy of your ID) and we will contact you.

If the student ask for a full refund, we reserve the right not to pay the class to the tutor.

CLASSGAP acts merely as an intermediary between students and teachers and is therefore not responsible for any claims that may arise in respect of cancellations or refunds made, errors in them, or the teacher's decision not to make them when the class has been made. In the event that the student requests a refund of the price paid within 7 calendar days of booking the class, provided that there are more than 48 hours left to start the class, and the class has not been completed, CLASSGAP will study the reasons for this request and, if it considers them justified, may proceed to a refund, informing the teacher of the reasons for it.

#### Why does Classgap use local data storage on its websites and apps?

We use local data storage for a variety of purposes, such as: enabling us to perform our services; providing you with relevant, personalized content when you visit our websites; measuring and analyzing traffic to our websites; improving our services; and targeting specific advertising. Further details on these issues are given below.

#### Who else uses local data storage on Classgap?

We use local data storage ourselves, and allow our suppliers to use it when providing their services to us. These providers are subject to the agreements of data processors, and are not permitted to use the data for purposes other than providing the service we have requested.

In addition to our own use, we also offer third parties the opportunity to use data storage on your device when you visit our services.

#### Application areas for local data storage:
