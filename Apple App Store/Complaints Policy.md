Additional information
----------------------

At Apple we are committed to being transparent, treating developers fairly, and resolving concerns developers may have as efficiently and effectively as possible. In addition to addressing P2B complaints, we provide multiple channels for developers to contact Apple, including the following:

### [Developer support](https://developer.apple.com/contact/)

Developer Support is often the starting point for assistance with the following categories of issues:

* Membership and account
* Development and technical
* App setup and distribution
* Reports and payments
* Events
* Report a concern
* Feedback and other topics

### [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/)

Developers can submit feedback to Apple using the native Feedback Assistant app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, or the Feedback Assistant website. After developers submit feedback, they receive a Feedback ID to track the submission within the app or on the website.

### [App Store content dispute](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstorenotices/#)

Developers who believe that an application or Search Ad available in the App Store violates their intellectual property rights can submit a claim to the App Store Legal Team.

### [App name dispute](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appnamenotices/)

Developers who believe an app is preventing them from using their trademark as an app name on the App Store can submit a claim to the App Store Legal Team.

### [Expedite App Review](https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/?topic=expedite)

Developers facing extenuating circumstances can request the review of their app be expedited.

### [Resolve submission issues](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/reply-to-app-review-messages/)

If an app has been rejected, developers can communicate with Apple and resolve issues in App Store Connect. A communication from Apple contains information about an app rejection, including how the app is out of compliance with App Store Review Guidelines. Developers can correspond with Apple through App Store Connect and resubmit the build to App Review. Developers can include attachments in their replies, such as screenshots and supporting documents. If an app has been rejected because of a metadata issue, developers can resolve the issue and resubmit the same build.

### [App rejection and removal appeal](https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/?topic=appeal)

If developers disagree with the outcome of our review, either because they think we misunderstood their app or our review was unfair, they may file an appeal and we will investigate.

### [Suggest a guideline change](https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/?topic=guideline)

Our goal is to apply the App Store Review Guidelines fairly and consistently. If an app has been rejected and developers are unable to resolve the issues after corresponding with App Review, they may suggest a change to the guidelines.

### [Reinstate a terminated membership](https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/)

Developers may petition the App Review Board to reinstate their account by completing a form and providing specific reasons the App Review Board should consider reinstatement of their account.

#### Improvements and updates

Starting in January 2022, all developers were transitioned to the new, improved submission process in App Store Connect where recent message history with App Review is still available even after an updated app version is submitted.

We value feedback, take complaints seriously, and continually seek to improve the App Store to provide the most trusted place to discover and download apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful.
