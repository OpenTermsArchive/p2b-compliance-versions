    * to respond to requests by government or law enforcement authorities conducting an investigation.
        

**Objecting to direct marketing**

In the UK, we are able to send you direct marketing in your professional capacity without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests.  You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time. You can do this by following the instructions in the communication where this is an electronic message, or by contacting us using the details set out below.

**Who will we share personal data with, where and when?**

Personal data will be shared with third party service providers who process it on behalf of Skyscanner for the purposes identified above. In particular, we use third party providers of IT systems (such as client/supplier relationship management platforms, accounting systems, portal/website platforms and email platforms), hosting and maintenance.

Additionally, we will share Personal Data with Your Organisation, where required to facilitate the relationship between Skyscanner and Your Organisation, or where we are asked (or choose to) provide feedback about you.

Personal data may be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials if required for the purposes above, if mandated by law or if required for the legal protection of our legitimate interests in compliance with applicable laws.

In the event that the business is sold or integrated with another business, your details will be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s adviser and will be passed to the new owners of the business.

Some of the third party service providers we use are located outside, or process personal data outside, the UK and EEA. Where information is transferred outside the UK or the EEA, and where this is to a stakeholder or vendor in a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, data is adequately protected by EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses, or Binding Corporate Rules, along with any necessary supplementary measures.

**What rights do I have?**

You have the right to **ask us for a copy** of your personal data; to **correct**, **delete** or **restrict** (stop any active) processing of your personal data; and to **obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format**, and to ask us to **share (port) this data to another controller.**

In addition, you can **object to the processing** of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing).

These **rights may be limited**, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, where they would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. Relevant exemptions are included in both the EU and UK GDPR, and in the Data Protection Act 2018 and other applicable national data protection laws. If relevant, we will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.

To exercise any of these rights you can get in touch with us – or our data protection officer – using the details set out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the **right to complain** to an EU data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.

**What are the consequences of not providing my personal data?**

For processing required to establish you as a point of contact for Your Organisation, provision of your name, job title/role, Your Organisation, region and corporate contact details is mandatory, along with any other information marked as required in forms you may submit to us. If this data is not provided, then we will not be able to communicate with you in order to procure goods and services from, or provide goods and services to, Your Organisation, or provide you with access to Skyscanner’s partner platforms. All other provision of your information is optional.

**How long will you retain my personal data?**
