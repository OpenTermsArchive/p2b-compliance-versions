How Skyscanner Operates
=======================

![](https://content.skyscnr.com/m/5f9c23e5c6810c62/original/VB34181738.jpg)

This page provides information for Skyscanner’s commercial partners pursuant to EU Regulation 2019/1150 on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services and to consumers pursuant to the “Directive on Better Enforcement and Modernisation of EU Consumer Protection” (Directive (EU) 2019/2161). On this page, we’ll refer to these pieces of legislation as the “P2B Regulation” and the “Omnibus Directive” respectively.   It also provides general information around Skyscanner’s business model and how it operates.

If you’re one of our travellers looking for information about our services, you’ll ﬁnd more relevant information elsewhere on our site, such as [here.](https://www.skyscanner.net/about-us)

For our partners, the information below and the pages that are linked to are supplementary to any commercial agreements that we have with you.

The information below is not intended to replace those arrangements and, to the extent that there’s any conﬂict between the information contained here and the agreements we have with you (as either may be superseded from time to time) then those agreements will prevail.

More detail about the beneﬁts of partnering with Skyscanner are available at our dedicated [Partners](https://www.partners.skyscanner.net/) site.

Components of our relationship with our partners
------------------------------------------------

Skyscanner partners engage with us on the basis of:

* A Partner Order Form – this details the speciﬁc commercial arrangements we have with each partner, including the type of content which our partners provide to us, which markets are served and the pricing information related to that content. The partner order form is issued at the conclusion of our commercial negotiations with partners. The partner order form incorporates the other components noted below into our contract with our partners by reference (along with other key policies that all our partners are subject to, such as our [anti-bribery code of conduct](https://www.skyscanner.net/media/anti-bribery-code-skyscanner) and [modern slavery policy](https://www.skyscanner.net/media/modern-slavery) all of which may be updated from time to time). Partner order forms can be replaced entirely with a new partner order form when we agree new or amended terms with our partners, or else they might be adjusted by written agreement (such as via a letter of variation).
* Skyscanner’s standard [**Partner Terms**](https://www.skyscanner.net/media/ltdterms) – these are updated periodically. When we make changes to these terms, this will be indicated by a new date stamp at the footer of the partner terms. Unless we need to do so faster for urgent reasons (such as to protect our travellers or where we’re legally required to) we will give at least 15 days’ notice of changes. Historical versions of the Partner Terms will still be accessible through the Skyscanner partner [portal](https://skyscannerpartnersupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) (which you may need to register to access) or upon request from us. When we update the Partner Terms, we will highlight any material changes to our partners. The Partner Terms provide details of circumstances where a partner – or some or all of their content – may be removed from Skyscanner.
* Skyscanner’s [**Partner Policy**](https://skyscannerpartnersupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004848773-Partner-Policy) and [**Payment Policy**](https://skyscannerpartnersupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004870414-Skyscanner-Payment-Policy) – these policies help Skyscanner ensure that the information we provide to our travellers is clear, accurate and consistent. Our Partner Policy speciﬁcally sets out the basis on which our partners’ content may need to be removed from Skyscanner, such as where we ﬁnd it is not accurate and may harm or disadvantage our travellers. Removal of that content can happen automatically where our accuracy tools identify an issue, but also where we become aware of a potential issue that we need to investigate (such as an increase in traveller complaints about that partner).
* Any other agreement which we agree to implement, including in relation to data processing and controlling and any other policies which Skyscanner implements and provides notice of to you.

Information about how Skyscanner ranks results
----------------------------------------------

Skyscanner seeks to be clear and transparent in how we rank results, and we provide results in the manner which we believe is best suited to the users of our site. We do not rank results based on commission levels, other than where as expressly set out below..

This section applies only to our search results and not to sponsored links or adverts that may be included within or near search results (which will be marked or distinguished accordingly). This will also not apply where our travellers have modiﬁed the criteria that applies to search results.

Where our users have requested or permitted that we provide personalised results, based on their preferences, these will affect the display of results, therefore content which does not ﬁt the selection criteria will either not be displayed or will be ranked differently based on those criteria.

We have set out below the main parameters which inﬂuence how our results are ranked. Our partners can obtain more detailed information at any time by reaching out to their usual Skyscanner commercial manager, via the partner portal or other contact methods. If you are a new partner, please reach us via the dedicated [partner site f](https://www.partners.skyscanner.net/)or more information.

We also add different coloured “call to action” (CTA) buttons on partner selection screens, as well as explanatory wording on or around the CTA, to distinguish whether the partner booking option is based on redirecting to a third-party site or part of our direct booking framework.

### For Flights

We make it easy for travellers to ﬁlter results by several different parameters which we believe best ﬁt what our travellers want. We add and remove ﬁlter options from time to time, based on user demand. The ﬁlters which our travellers search by naturally determine the ranking of results.

Our default ranking parameter for ﬂight search results is “**best**”.

Best is as explained on our site within the search results header and takes into account factors such as: (i) price; (ii) speed (i.e. overall time of journey, including layovers); (iii) whether or not a ﬂight is direct or segmented; (iv) departure/arrival times; (v) our “Partner Quality Score” rating (explained below); (vi) click- through rate and other factors. We believe that these are the most useful criteria on which to sort results to deliver what our travellers need.

Additionally, we apply a “Greener Choice” tag to certain results to highlight the carbon dioxide output for that particular result, based on third party data we source, to demonstrate the relative carbon dioxide output for some operators over others. This is based on the result which provides the least CO2 output for the selected inventory, and will take into account relative efﬁciency and capacity of aircraft. More data can be found [here.](https://www.skyscanner.net/environment)

As explained in our [Partner Policy](https://skyscannerpartnersupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004848773-Partner-Policy) we will remove content which fails to meet the standards we hold all of our partners to, which means that it will not appear (or re-appear) until the issue is resolved.

The operation of our Partner Quality Score, “PQS”,  typically means that, even where prices between different partners are equal, we are able to utilise criteria based on the PQS to rank those partners (to avoid a tie in ranking). In the limited circumstances where results are tied absolutely based on these criteria, we will rank as ﬁrst the partner whose name comes first in the alphabet.

### For Accommodation

As with Flights, the hotels that we show are default ranked by “**Best**” which takes into account factors such as (i) price; (ii)location (based on proximity to city centres or key tourist attractions and customer review); (iii) the number of partners providing inventory for that hotel; (iv) the quality of content such as images that we are provided with; and (v) popularity (measured by click-through rates and ratio of clicks to bookings). For each hotel that we return a result for there will usually be several partners who can provide inventory for that hotel. We rank results for partners in order of the lowest price offered. We do not rank results based on the commission that Skyscanner receives, other than where the other criteria used for ranking results in a tied result, in which case the partner who pays us a higher commission level will be ranked higher.

### For Car Hire

Our car hire results are displayed according to vehicle category based on: (i) [ACRISS codes](https://www.acriss.org/car-codes/) (ii) the supplier, if known, with the lowest price available for the inventory displayed; and (iii) the number of partners offering the vehicle category/supplier combination. An additional element that deﬁnes which group a partner appears under is if they offer free cancellation up to 48 hours before pick-up.

Travellers can then expand the number of partners by clicking “select” for the type of vehicle, after which results from all partners offering the vehicle/supplier combination will be displayed in order of ascending price.

We display against each result other key information such as underlying vehicle provider and fuel policy, as well as a PQS rating against the partner, but this does not alter the ranking of results.

Where there is a tie on all other criteria, we randomly generate the order in which partners would be displayed so as to avoid any bias. We do not rank results based on commercial advantage to Skyscanner.

Our Partner Quality Score
-------------------------

This rating, which is displayed against a partner in a star format, takes into account several factors, including: (i) the volume of traffic and associated sales the partner has supplied to Skyscanner (because this directly inﬂuences our ability to score the remaining criteria with enough quantitative data); (ii) accuracy of pricing information and availability; (iii) number of user complaints about that partner and the speed of resolution of complaints; and (iv) the quality of service on the partner’s website (such as the page loading speed). The rating only appears where we have a sufﬁcient level of feedback on partners to allow for an accurate representative evaluation of performance. This allows us to maintain the integrity of the rating system used.

We work with the majority of our partners to provide feedback about PQS ratings, how these are calculated and how we can work together to improve them for the beneﬁt of our travellers.

Self Preferencing
-----------------

Other group companies of Skyscanner, such as our parent company Trip.com and our sister company Travix appear as suppliers on Skyscanner. Neither are subject to preferential ranking on our products, and in all cases, they are subject to the same criteria and policies as any third-party supplier.

Internal complaints handling
----------------------------

If you’re one of our travellers looking to make a complaint about Skyscanner or about one of our partners, then please contact our user satisfaction team via this [link.](https://help.skyscanner.net/hc/en-gb?skyCurrency=currency_gbp&skyLanguage=lang_en&skyMarket=uk_skyscanner&_mp=1735c6388cb2a3-0898cf5b40a4de-b7a1334-e1000-1735c6388cc4a7_1595259674202&acq=90281323-2f39-471a-bae8-d20943e9e255%7Cf556585e-b8ab-4178-bf21-a4034c7582b2&preferences=04828c8ee6194b15a1c32ccc0af56730&auth_traveller_context=9570c4e6-6d66-431b-a52f-1fc68e2334cb&_ga=2.27265269.872063930.1595242843-1674301932.1594982845) The complaints handling process set out on this page is speciﬁcally for our commercial partners to raise issues with us.

For complaints about Skyscanner from our commercial partners, please ﬁrst raise your concern or complaint with your regular commercial manager.

In the event your complaint is not resolved satisfactorily, and where it relates to a matter that’s covered by the P2B Regulation, please contact your commercial manager at Skyscanner and ask them to commence the **P2B Regulation Complaint Process**.

Mediation
