All transactions with Wish users are between you and the user, and you will be the seller of record. Wish is not a party to any transaction although we will provide certain services in connection with the transaction, as set forth in the Agreement.

You use the Services at your own risk. Wish is not responsible or liable for any content, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, products, services, listings, links, or information posted or provided by you, other merchants, or other third parties on or through any of the Services.

You agree not to share your login credentials with any third parties. You agree not to use the same login credentials for your account that you use for any other platform.

Wish strongly encourages the use of two factor authentication to add an additional layer of security.

### Account Information:

You must keep your account information up to date and accurate at all times, including a valid name, address, phone number, email address, and bank account information. To sell Products on the Services you must provide and maintain valid payment information. You authorize us (and will provide us documentation evidencing your authorization upon our request) to verify your information (including any updated information), to obtain credit reports about you from time to time, to obtain credit authorizations from the issuer of your credit card, and, in limited circumstances, to charge your credit card or debit your bank account for any sums payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise). You also agree to provide Wish any additional information, documents (including identity documents), or authorizations as may be necessary for Wish to provide the Services or for you to fulfill your obligations under this Agreement.

### Account Transfer:

You may not transfer or sell your account, username, or associated payment provider or processor account to another party nor may you register multiple merchant accounts at any time. If you are registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement. Failure to abide by this section shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement and may result in your accounts being removed from the platform.

### Right to Refuse Service:

Wish reserves the right to cancel unconfirmed or inactive accounts, to refuse to offer and restrict, suspend, or disable any part of the Services to you, issue penalties, to cancel orders, remove your listings, and delete all data or other information associated with your account (including any materials you may have submitted to us), among other remedies or actions we may take pursuant to this Agreement or Applicable Laws, for any violation or suspected violation of this Agreement or Applicable Laws, with or without notice to you. We may also discontinue the Services or any part of the Services and delete all data or other information associated with your account (including any materials you may submit to us). We assume no liability for any information removed from the Services, and we reserve the right to permanently restrict your access to the Services or your account. You agree that you do not have any rights in the Services and that we have no liability to you if the Services are discontinued or if you are no longer able to access the Services or any information that was previously made available to you on the Services.

### Closing Your Account:

You may choose to close your account by contacting merchant\_notices@wish.com. We will notify you when your account has been closed. If we are unable to close your account, you will receive an email detailing why your account cannot be closed and any additional steps or information that may be required from you before closing your account. The closure of your account does not extinguish any of your obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of any amounts due to Wish, nor does it preclude Wish from pursuing any remedy against you for any violation or suspected violation of this Agreement or any Applicable Laws.

3\. Fees and Payment
--------------------

### Fees:

Wish will collect, earn or receive commissions, fees, payments or other amounts from you, for your use of or access to the Services and or when you sell a Product using the Services as set forth in the [Fees and Payments Policy](https://merchant.wish.com/policy/fees_and_payments) or as otherwise communicated to you by Wish. Wish may charge listing fees (the "Listing Fees") related to the offering and sale of certain products or services, including but not limited to, the number of products available in your product catalog. Such fees may be assessed on a per item basis or after a merchant has reached a limit (as determined by Wish) on the number of items being offered for sale on the platform. Moreover, the amount of fees and/or item limits may differ between tiers of merchants as determined by Wish in its sole discretion. If any fees are assessed, they will be collected according to a schedule and we will notify all Merchants of such schedule in accordance with this Agreement. If Wish charges Listing Fees for excessive product listings, we will notify all Merchants of the time period for determining such Listing Fees in accordance with this Agreement. Additional Wish products and services (e.g., ProductBoost) may be subject to additional or different terms and fees. We reserve the right to change the commission or fees charged from time to time and will notify you in advance of such changes; however, no advance notice is required for temporary promotions or changes that result in the reduction of commissions or fees.

### Payment:

Wish will make payments to you of the amount that we collect from the sale of your Products, less any commission earned, fees charged, and other amounts owed in connection with all aspects of your use of the Services, as set forth in the [Fees and Payments Policy](https://merchant.wish.com/policy/fees_and_payments), except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or as otherwise communicated to you by Wish.

Wish will pay all amounts owed to you to the payment provider or processor you have designated by means specified by us. Any amount due to you under this Agreement shall be considered made and complete, and any payment obligation extinguished, upon remittance to such payment provider or processor. Each payment provider or processor may have its own terms of use or other legal requirements which you are subject to. Wish is not responsible for any services provided by or fees owed to any such payment provider or processor (including, any remittance of payment, security protocols or obligations to the merchant, accurate and timely disbursal of payments to the merchant, or unavailability of such third party services). The risk of loss and nonpayment from the payment provider or processor remains solely with you.

For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (a) charge your account or any payment instrument you provide to us; (b) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement, converting balances in your account to Wish, or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (c) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (d) reverse any credits to you; or (e) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. In addition, Wish may in its sole discretion elect to withhold any amounts payable to you under this Agreement, until such time as Wish receives valid confirmation of Product delivery. Transactions for which Wish cannot confirm valid delivery may be ineligible for payment and may subject your account balance to temporary or permanent holds or account suspension.

Furthermore, even if the product has been delivered, if Wish determines that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations, or suspected violations of this Agreement, or other risks to Wish or third parties, or reflect pending or otherwise unrecoupable balances, then Wish may, in its sole discretion, withhold, delay, or offset any payments to be made or are otherwise due to you for as long as Wish determines such conditions or any related risks to Wish or third parties persist.

If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or other illegal activity, or to violate this Agreement, then we may permanently withhold, or offset and retain any payments that otherwise may have been payable to you in our sole discretion. In addition, we may require that you pay other amounts to secure the performance of your obligations under this Agreement or to mitigate the risk of returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations, or suspected violations of this Agreement, or other risks to Wish or third parties. These amounts may be refundable or nonrefundable in the manner we determine, which may include converting balances in your account to Wish, and failure to comply with this Agreement may result in their forfeiture.

4\. Appointment of Wish as Limited Payment Collection Agent
-----------------------------------------------------------

You hereby appoint Wish as your payment collection agent, solely for the limited purpose of accepting funds from users who purchase Products through the Services.

You agree that any funds resulting from a user's purchase of any product or service through the Services and received by Wish from a user shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to you by a user. You further agree that you will provide the purchased Products to the user in the agreed-upon manner as if you have received the payment directly from the user. You agree that Wish may refund the user in accordance with Wish's [Return Policy](https://wish.com/return_policy). As stated above, you understand and agree that Wish's obligation to pay you is subject to and conditioned upon successful receipt of the associated funds from users who purchase items through the Services. Wish guarantees payments to you only for such amounts that have been successfully received by Wish from users in accordance with this Agreement and Wish's [Terms of Use](https://wish.com/terms) and that are not subject to refunds made to users. In accepting appointment as your limited payment collection agent, Wish assumes no liability for any of your acts or omissions (including any violation by you of this Agreement or any Applicable Laws).

You agree that any obligation of a user to pay you for the purchase of any Products through the Services is extinguished upon the user's payment of the funds to Wish, upon which Wish then is responsible for remitting the funds to you in the manner described in this Agreement, the [Fees and Payments](https://merchant.wish.com/policy/fees_and_payments) Policy, or as otherwise communicated by Wish to you. Your funds are not eligible for payment to you unless and until all terms in this Agreement, the [Fees and Payments](https://merchant.wish.com/policy/fees_and_payments) Policy, and Wish's [Terms of Use](https://wish.com/terms) are satisfied. In the event that Wish does not remit any such payment or funds to you, you will have recourse only against Wish and not the user directly.

You agree that Wish may honor any governmental or judicial order attaching, garnishing, or levying upon funds otherwise payable to you hereunder and that any payment to a governmental authority or a third party pursuant to a court order by Wish as required by such order shall relieve Wish of any obligation to pay such funds to you.

You further agree that Wish shall have no obligation to invest such funds for your account and that you shall not be entitled to any interest earned on such funds while such funds are in the possession of Wish.

Wish shall have the right to offset its obligation to pay you such funds to satisfy any obligation then owing by you to Wish. Wish shall otherwise have no interest in the funds that it holds for you as paying agent, and any liability for taxation or otherwise related to such funds shall be entirely yours.

Wish will disburse funds owed hereunder to you upon your written instruction and shall have the right to rely on such written instruction. Under no circumstance shall Wish be obligated to advance to you funds it does not hold as your paying agent.

Wish reserves the right to resign as your paying agent and cancel your account at any time.

5\. Listing and Selling
-----------------------

### Product Guidelines:

This Agreement and the [Listing Policy](https://merchant.wish.com/policy) describe the general obligations regarding Products that you may and may not list on the Services. You may sell a Product on the Services if you are an authorized reseller of that Product or purchase or otherwise legally acquired that Product from an authorized reseller of that Product, or otherwise have a legal right to sell that Product. The [Prohibited Products Policy](https://merchant.wish.com/policy) provides more detail regarding categories of products and products which you are prohibited from listing and selling. You will not list, market, promote, offer for sale, or sell any Products through the Services in violation of this Agreement or Applicable Laws.

### Listing Description:

In order to list a Product for sale on the Services, you must truthfully, accurately, and completely provide all requested Content (as defined below) related to the Product. You must, and are solely responsible for, truthfully, accurately, and completely describing your Products, providing Content relevant to that Product, and providing all terms of sale on Product listings and in your merchant shop on the Services. If the Product fits into a category that is subject to specific product guidelines, you may be required to provide additional Content, documentation, or certifications for those types of Products. Wish does not have any responsibility for, or obligations related to, the descriptions of your Products.

Upon our request, you will promptly provide us with (i) certificates of authenticity (or similar documentation), (ii) documentation (e.g., email verifications from the brand owner or supplier) showing that you have a legal right to sell Products through the Services, (iii) documentation (e.g., email verifications from applicable rights holders) showing that you are licensed or otherwise have a right to use any Content, (iv) supply chain documentation and country of origin information, (v) manufacturer information, (vi) Declaration of Conformity for applicable products, and (vii) any other information or documentation requested by us.

You understand and agree that Wish is not the seller of any Product you list for sale, and that Wish has no control over and does not give any commitment relating to the existence, quality, safety, genuineness, legality, or any other aspect of such Product, the truth, accuracy, or completeness of any information or materials you provide to Wish or make available to users related to such Product, the ability of a user to pay for the Product, and whether the user may return or seek a refund or cancellation for such Product. You further understand and agree that Wish will have no liability related to your Products, including but not limited to liability with respect to authenticity of the Products, any alleged intellectual property infringement, and/or the quality or fitness of purpose of the Products.

### Shop Policies:

Wish may permit you, in certain circumstances, to outline shop policies for your merchant shop. These policies may include, for example, shipping, returns, payment, and selling policies. You must create reasonable policies in good faith and must abide at all times with such policies. You are prohibited from creating any policies that are deceptive or inaccurate. All shop policies must comply with this Agreement and all Applicable Laws. You are responsible for enforcing your own shop policies. In the event of conflict between your shop policies and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control as it relates to your use of the Services.

### Fulfillment:

Once Wish has transmitted a user's order to you, you will be solely responsible for, and bear all liability for, the fulfillment of such order, including packaging and shipping Products. You agree to comply with and abide by the [Fulfillment Policy](https://merchant.wish.com/policy). The obligations set forth in this section may not apply if you participate in certain fulfillment programs offered by Wish to you, but only to the limited extent such obligations are covered by the services that Wish provides through such programs.

### Third Party Service Providers:

To the extent you use any third party to assist or facilitate any portion of your use of the Services, including your listings, sales, fulfillment, system notifications or changes, customer support, or other functions, you agree that you shall be responsible for and Wish shall not be liable for any acts, conduct, errors, omissions, losses, claims or other issues resulting from your use of such third party's services.

### Nonconformity, Defects, or Other Issues with Items:

Wish will have no responsibility or liability for any nonconformity, defect in, or any recalls (public or private, voluntary or mandatory) of Products any User may obtain through Wish. You are solely responsible for any nonconformity, defect in, or any recall of, as well as any other safety issues related to your Products. You will notify Wish as soon as you become aware of, or reasonably suspect, any nonconformity, defect in, safety concerns, or recall related to your Products and you will immediately remove any such Product from the Services. If we determine that the performance of your obligations under this Agreement may result in returns, claims, disputes, or violations of this Agreement, or cause any other risks to us or third parties, then we may mitigate them, including by determining whether a user will receive a refund, adjustment, or replacement for any of your Products for as long as we determine any related risks to us or third parties persist. If you offer a product for sale through our Services that requires a warning under California Health & Safety Code Section 25249.6 (a "Proposition 65 Warning") you will provide in your listing such warning in the manner compliant with Applicable Laws and will only revise or remove a Proposition 65 Warning for a Product when the prior warning is no longer legally required.

If you offer products with health, safety, or environmental conformity requirements, you will provide in your listing the applicable marking or labeling for the jurisdictions in which the product is marketed (e.g. CE, KC, and/or FCC mark). You agree that applicable products have the required marking or labeling on the product itself or on the packaging materials as required by the jurisdiction of the shipping destination. Wish provides the medium for you to upload compliance documentation, including but not limited to Declaration of Conformity, technical documentation, test reports, and compliance marking. You are required to provide additional compliance documentation to Wish upon request.

### No Transfer of Title:

In no event shall title to any Products transfer to Wish, even if Wish takes possession of a Product in connection with any sale, product return, or disposition of abandoned products, including any Products that are not retrieved by a user for more than 30 days as set forth below.

UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING BETWEEN YOU AND WISH, WISH DISCLAIMS ANY DUTIES OF A BAILEE OR WAREHOUSEMAN, AND YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF A BAILOR ARISING UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAWS (WHETHER ARISING UNDER COMMON LAW, CIVIL LAW, STATUTE OR OTHERWISE) RELATING TO ANY POSSESSION, STORAGE, SHIPMENT, OR DISPOSAL OF YOUR PRODUCTS BY WISH, OUR AFFILIATES OR ANY OF OUR OR THEIR DESIGNEES, CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS.

### User Support:

Wish may provide you with a mode by which you may receive and respond to inquiries from Wish users, including questions about product issues, shipping, delivery, returns, and refunds. In such an event, you understand and agree that Wish may establish certain service-level agreements ("SLAs") related to your responses (e.g., timing to respond, types of permitted communications with customers, etc.), to which you will be required to adhere.

You further agree that Wish, in its sole discretion (and including in the event you do not respond in accordance with an SLA), also may, but is not obligated to, provide support to your customers as a service to you, including with respect to complaint intake and answering questions about logistics (including shipping, delivery, returns, and refunds), without taking title to any products and provision of such support shall not, and shall not be deemed to, transfer title to Wish.

If you have a dispute with any user or third party over any product, service, offering, or interaction over the Services, you agree not to make any claim of any kind or nature against Wish or its Affiliates with respect to such dispute, no matter whether any claims, requirements or compensation of damages are known, insured, or released.

### Disposition of Products in Compliance with Legal Requirement:

Wish, directly or through its designee, shall have the right to take possession and dispose of products to comply with any Applicable Laws or any order or other requirement of any court, mediator, arbitrator, or other governmental authority and to withhold or offset any payments to you for all costs incurred by Wish in connection with such disposal. Such action shall not, and shall not be deemed to, transfer title to Wish.

Third Party Platforms: Wish has or may enter into relationships with third parties that support the marketing, sale, and fulfillment of any merchant's Products through such third parties' platforms and applications or channels of trade ("Third Party Platforms"), either as part of, or as a separate offering from, the Services. You acknowledge and agree that Wish may, and you hereby expressly authorize Wish to, market, promote, publish, display, offer for sale, sell, or fulfill your Products through any Third Party Platform, whether as part of the Services or separate from the Services, whether concurrently with or in lieu of the Services, or whether you are required to create an account with any Third Party Platform.

### Other: 

In certain circumstances, some Merchants may be eligible for greater exposure of products or listings on the platform that other Merchants. Some examples include, but are not limited to, (i) Products offered by merchants that participate in the one or more programs or initiatives (whether permanent programs or experimental programs or initiatives) or services may receive greater impressions due to economic and commercial reasons; (ii) Products offered by merchants with high ratings may be featured more prominently over those offered by merchants with lower ratings; (iii) Products offered by merchants with low refund rates may be featured more prominently over those offered by merchants with higher refund rates; (iv) Products offered by merchants in regions in close proximity to a user may be featured more prominently over products offered outside those regions; (v) Products offered by Affiliates might be featured more prominently for economic and commercial reasons; (vi) Products whose merchants offer faster shipping options may be featured more prominently over Products whose merchants offer slower shipping options; (vii) Products whose merchants offer lower prices may be featured more prominently over merchants offering the same Product for more; (viii) the length of relationship between Wish and the merchant; or (ix) the nature of the Product sold or the volume of sales by the merchant. Wish also may consider a merchant's compliance with these terms of service, Wish Standards and/or other Merchant Compliance guidelines.

Product listings on the Services, including those resulting from user searches, are ranked according to various factors. Wish reserves the right to limit the number of Product listings in your catalog by removing Product listings upon our discretion. You will be notified if Product Listings are removed by Wish.

You acknowledge and agree that pricing you establish genuinely reflects the price the consumer is obligated to pay for the item (with the addition of reasonable shipping costs).

You acknowledge and agree that any reference to a "retail price" reflects a legitimate and genuine price of items actually sold for a notable period of time in a retail store. You represent and agree that reference prices are not misleading and genuinely reflect selling conditions and past purchases. You agree that Wish may offer incentives that may lower the final price of the product. You acknowledge Wish sponsored incentives will not change your final commission.

6\. Prohibited, Questionable, and Infringing Items and Activities
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You are solely responsible for you and any of your affiliates' conduct and activities on or relating to the Services and any and all data, text, descriptions, pricing, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, products, items, listings, links, names, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and other content that you submit, post, or display on the Services (collectively, "Content"). Wish may, in its sole discretion or upon receipt of a notification alleging infringement, remove listings or Content from the Services, or prohibit you or ask you to refrain from listing any Product or providing Content.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, WISH (FOR ITSELF AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS (i) ALL WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING ANY SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES) AND THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY; FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, (ii) IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR TRADE USAGE; (iii) ANY OBLIGATION, LIABILITY, RIGHT, CLAIM OR REMEDY IN TORT, WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM WISH'S NEGLIGENCE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR USE, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, TIMELY, OR SECURE. WISH WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SYSTEM FAILURES OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS THAT MAY AFFECT THE RECEIPT, PROCESSING, ACCEPTANCE, COMPLETION, OR SETTLEMENT OF ANY TRANSACTION. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION (ORAL OR WRITTEN) OBTAINED BY YOU FROM WISH (OR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS) SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND THAT ANY CONTENT OR OTHER INFORMATION YOU SEND OR RECEIVE DURING YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES MAY NOT BE SECURE AND MAY BE INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE ACCESSED BY UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES. YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, WISH IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY OR DATA THAT RESULTS FROM ANY MATERIALS YOU ACCESS OR DOWNLOAD FROM THE SERVICES.

IF YOU RELY ON ANY DATA OR INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OF SUCH DATA OR INFORMATION.

CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

13\. Limitation of Liability; General Release
---------------------------------------------

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING TORT, CONTRACT, WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL WISH (OR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST SALES, OR OPPORTUNITY OR LOST DATA, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SERVICES OR ANY THIRD PARTY PLATFORM, OR YOUR OR ANY THIRD PARTY'S USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR ANY THIRD PARTY PLATFORM, EVEN IF WISH, ITS AFFILIATES, OR ANY OTHER PERSON HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE COSTS OR DAMAGES.

THIS DISCLAIMER APPLIES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TO ANY DAMAGES OR INJURY ARISING FROM ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELETION, DEFECTS, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUSES, FILE CORRUPTION, COMMUNICATION-LINE FAILURE, NETWORK OR SYSTEM OUTAGE, YOUR LOSS OF PROFITS, ANY THEFT, DESTRUCTION, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OF, LOSS OR USE OF, ANY RECORD OR DATA, AND ANY OTHER TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE LOSS.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE TOTAL AGGREGATE AMOUNT THAT WISH IS LIABLE TO YOU EXCEED (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO WISH IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE THREE (3) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM.

WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN WISH AND YOU AND SHALL APPLY EVEN IF FOUND TO FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU DESPITE THE "CHOICE OF LAW" PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ABOVE APPLIES ONLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS.

WISH IS NOT A PARTY TO THE TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN USERS AND MERCHANTS AND OPERATES THE SERVICES TO CONNECT USERS TO MERCHANTS. IF A DISPUTE ARISES BETWEEN A USER AND MERCHANT, THE USER AND MERCHANT RELEASES WISH (AND ITS AGENTS, LICENSORS, OR EMPLOYEES) FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL OR CONSEQUENTLY) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.

IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF NEW JERSEY, THIS SECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO PREVENT A RIGHT TO RECOVER CERTAIN DAMAGES (INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES) WHERE A HARMED PERSON PROVES WITH THE REQUIRED EVIDENCE THAT THE HARM SUFFERED WAS THE RESULT OF THE DEFENDANT'S "ACTS OR OMISSIONS AND SUCH ACTS OR OMISSIONS WERE ACTUATED BY ACTUAL MALICE OR ACCOMPANIED BY A WANTON AND WILLFUL DISREGARD OF PERSONS WHO FORESEEABLY MIGHT BE HARMED BY THOSE ACTS OR OMISSIONS." SIMILARLY, THIS SECTION DOES NOT LIMIT WISH'S TORT LIABILITY UNDER NEW JERSEY LAW RESULTING FROM WISH'S OWN INTENTIONAL OR RECKLESS CONDUCT.

IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA, YOU SHALL AND HEREBY DO WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH SAYS: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY." IF YOU ARE NOT A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS UNDER ANY STATUTE OR COMMON LAW PRINCIPLE SIMILAR TO SECTION 1542 THAT GOVERNS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE JURISDICTION OF YOUR RESIDENCE.

14\. Indemnity

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD WISH, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR OFFICERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL ACTUAL OR ALLEGED DEMANDS, LITIGATION, ADMINISTRATIVE OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS, INVESTIGATIONS, INQUIRIES, CLAIMS, SUITS ("CLAIMS"), DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL), PENALTIES, FINES, SETTLEMENTS, COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES, DISBURSEMENTS OF COUNSEL, COURT COSTS, AND COSTS OF ANY INESTIGATION, DEFENSE, AND SETTLEMENT, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO TO (A) YOUR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS; (B) YOUR ACTUAL OR ALLEGED BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES YOU HAVE MADE; (C) YOUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR CONTENT, INCLUDING ANY ACTUAL OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER VIOLATION OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, VIOLATION OF ANY PRIVACY RIGHT, RIGHT OF PUBLICITY, OR THIRD PARTY AGREEMENT, VIOLATION OF ANY APPLICABLE LAWS, PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RELATED THERETO, USE ANY REPOSTING OF ANY CONTENT YOU PROVIDE, WISH'S EXERCISE OF THE LICENSE RIGHTS GRANTED TO WISH UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR BREACH OF THE WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION 7 OR ANY SECURITY BREACH OR SECURITY INCIDENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY SYSTEM OR TECHNOLOGY OWNED, CONTROLLED OR USED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR YOUR BUSINESS; (D) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY ACTIONS TAKEN BY A THIRD PARTY USING YOUR ACCOUNT); (E) YOUR ACTS AND OMISSIONS; AND (F) YOUR TAXES (AS DEFINED BELOW).

IF ANY INDEMNIFIED CLAIM MIGHT ADVERSELY AFFECT WISH, WISH MAY IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION VOLUNTARILY INTERVENE IN THE PROCEEDINGS AND TAKE CONTROL OF THE DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED CLAIM. WISH'S ELECTION TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE DEFENSE AND/OR SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM SHALL NOT BE A WAIVER OF THIS SECTION. ANY FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED BECAUSE OF WISH'S INTERVENTION IN THE PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PAID OR REIMBURSED BY YOU AS A PART OF YOUR INDEMNITY OBLIGATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

IF YOU DEFEND ANY INDEMNIFIED CLAIM, YOU WILL USE COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO US TO DEFEND SUCH INDEMNIFIED CLAIM.

You understand and agree that you will only use the Tax ID Number in relation to sales carried out on the Services. If you use the Tax ID Number inappropriately in any way, Wish may, in its sole discretion, withhold or offset retaining amounts otherwise due to you, issue a penalty, suspend your account, terminate your account, or take any other actions Wish deems appropriate for so long as Wish in its sole discretion believes that you used the Tax ID Number inappropriately. Inappropriate usage of the Tax ID Number includes, but is not limited to, the following scenarios:

* using the Tax ID Number for shipments related to sales carried out outside the Services (e.g., via another online marketplace);
    
* transmitting the Tax ID Number to your freight forwarder in an insecure manner;
    
* communicating the Tax ID Number to other persons; or
    
* disclosing the Tax ID Number anywhere.

You agree that you are responsible for remitting indirect tax, custom duties, and other charges or fees levied by the EU or UK for order with the consignment value of the customs set threshold.

Where Applicable Laws state otherwise and Wish does not choose or is not required to calculate or collect any indirect taxes or custom duties, you may be required to calculate and collect any taxes. We strongly encourage you to consult your own tax experts based on your facts and circumstances.

In an effort to maintain compliance with U.S. or international tax law, Wish may require you to provide a valid indirect tax registration number or any other document to sell on the Services.
