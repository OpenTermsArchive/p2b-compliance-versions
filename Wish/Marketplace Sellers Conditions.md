You use the Services at your own risk. You will comply with these Terms and all Additional Terms and Policies applicable to any products or services you provide through or offer in connection with the Services.

If you have a dispute with any third party over any product, service, offering, or interaction over the Services, you agree not to make any claim of any kind or nature against Wish or its Affiliates with respect to such dispute, no matter whether any claims, requirements, or compensation of damages are known, insured, or released, as applicable under Applicable Laws.

Additionally, should you register an account, make purchases, or otherwise use our Services in a capacity other than as a merchant, seller, or distributor (e.g., as a purchasing consumer or retail customer), you agree to be bound by Wish’s [Terms of Use](https://wish.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://wish.com/privacy_policy) and those [Terms of Use](https://wish.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://wish.com/privacy_policy) shall govern such conduct.

In that instance, Wish will provide thirty (30) days’ advance notice of any such amendment if required by Applicable Laws to do so. The notice will be provided via electronic mail, the Wish Merchant Dashboard, the Wish Application Program Interface (“Wish API”), or other commercially reasonable means. Regarding any such amendment, you agree that the continuation of your use of the Services after receipt of the notice of such amendment shall constitute your acknowledgement and acceptance of any and all such changes, and it shall also constitute adequate consideration to support such change(s), which shall automatically be incorporated into this Agreement as of the effective date stated in the amendment.

Unless otherwise permitted by Applicable Laws, you agree that any amendment will only apply to Disputes that arise after the effective date of such amendment unless you have expressly agreed to such amendment.

Prior to the effective date of such proposed amendment, you may opt out of any proposed amendment by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: General Counsel, ContextLogic Inc., One Sansome Street, 33rd Fl., San Francisco, CA 94104, or by email to [merchant\_notices@wish.com](mailto:merchant_notices@wish.com). Wish reserves the right to cancel, within reason, your account and terminate your access to the Services if you do not agree to any proposed amendment, with proper notice.

You are fully responsible for all activity, liability, and damage resulting from your failure to maintain password confidentiality. You agree to immediately notify Wish of any unauthorized use or access of your password or your account or any other breach of security of your account. You also agree that Wish cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep your password secure or any unauthorized access of or other breach of security of your account. You agree not to provide your username and password information in combination to any other party other than Wish without Wish’s express written permission. You further agree not to use the same username or password for your Wish account that you use for any other account on any other platform.

Account Information: You must keep your account information up to date and accurate at all times, including a valid name, address, phone number, and email address. To sell items on Wish you must provide and maintain valid payment information, such as a valid PayPal account. As applicable under Applicable Laws, you authorize us (and will provide us documentation evidencing your authorization upon our request) to verify your information (including any updated information), to obtain credit reports about you from time to time, to obtain credit authorizations from the issuer of your credit card, and, in limited circumstances, to charge your credit card or debit your bank account for any sums payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise). You also agree to provide Wish any additional information or authorizations as may be necessary for Wish to provide the Services or for you to fulfill your obligations under this Agreement, including all applicable Additional Terms and Policies. All payments to you will be remitted to your bank account through a payment service provider you designate or by other means specified by us, as applicable under Applicable Laws. Depending on the payment method you choose, you may be required to provide a valid United States tax identification number via Form W-9 or proof of residency outside the United States via Form W-8BEN/W-8BEN-E.

Account Transfer: You may not transfer or sell your Wish Merchant account, username, or associated payment provider or processor account to another party. If you are registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement.

Right to Refuse Service: Wish reserves the right to cancel unconfirmed or inactive accounts or to refuse to offer the Services to you for any violation or suspected violation of this Agreement or Applicable Laws, with or without notice to you. We may also discontinue the Services or any part of the Services and delete all data or other information associated with your account (including any materials you may submit to us). We assume no liability for any information removed from the Services, and we reserve the right to permanently restrict access to the Services or your account. You agree that you do not have any rights in the Services and that we have no liability to you if the Services are discontinued or if you are no longer able to access the Services or any information that was previously made available to you on the Services.

Closing Your Account: You have the right to close your account. If you choose to close your account, please contact [merchant\_notices@wish.com](mailto:merchant_notices@wish.com). You will then receive a confirmation once your account has been closed. If Wish is unable to close your account at this time, you also will receive an email detailing why your account cannot be closed and any additional steps or information that may be required from you before closing your account. The closure of your account does not preclude Wish from pursuing legal action against you for any violation or suspected violation of this Agreement (including any Additional Terms or Policies) or any Applicable Laws, or initiating collection of fees or other payments due to Wish.

3\. Fees and Payment
--------------------

Fees: Wish will collect or receive fees, payments, or other amounts from you, for your use of or access to the Services, as set forth in its Policy on [Fees and Payments](https://merchant.wish.com/policy/fees_and_payments) or as otherwise communicated to you by Wish. Except as set forth in Sections 16 and 17 herein, you are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with using and selling on Wish.

As a merchant, you also may incur fees through the use of various payment providers or processors. Any such payment provider or processor fees will be determined by any agreement you may have with a payment provider or processor, and Wish is not responsible for reviewing, advising on, or paying any such fees.

Payment: Wish will make payments to you, in connection with your use of the Services, as set forth in this Agreement and its [Fees and Payments Policy](https://merchant.wish.com/policy/fees_and_payments) or as otherwise communicated to you by Wish. You understand and agree that Wish’s obligation to pay you is expressly subject to the terms of and your compliance with this Agreement and is conditioned upon Wish’s successful receipt of funds from Wish users who purchase items through the Services.

Payment by Wish to you is considered made and complete upon transmission by Wish of the payment amount owed to you pursuant to this Agreement and [Fees and Payments Policy](https://merchant.wish.com/policy/fees_and_payments) or as otherwise communicated to you by Wish, to the payment provider or processor you have selected (e.g., UMPAY, PayEco, AllPay, Payoneer, PayPal China, Bill.com, PingPong, or others as may be added or removed from time to time) irrespective of your receipt of payment from the payment provider or processor. Each payment provider or processor may have its own terms of use or other legal requirements, and Wish does not guarantee and is not responsible for any services provided by such payment provider or processor (including, without limitation, any remittance of payment, security protocols or obligations to the merchant, accurate and timely disbursal of payments to the merchant, non-availability of services, etc., of such payment provider or processor). Risk of loss and nonpayment from the payment provider or processor remains with you as the merchant.

In addition to the above, Wish may elect to delay the remittance and withhold the amounts payable to merchants, or any other payment due under this Agreement or its [Fees and Payments Policy](https://merchant.wish.com/policy/fees_and_payments) or as otherwise communicated to you by Wish, until such time as Wish receives valid confirmation of product delivery. Transactions for which Wish cannot confirm valid delivery may be ineligible for payment and may subject your account balance to temporary or permanent holds or account suspension.

In the event that Wish elects to remit an amount to you before the eligible payment date for such amount through a discretionary advance or advance made through your payment processor or provider (hereinafter, a “Discretionary Advance”), Wish may reduce your payment by the amount of the Discretionary Advance either immediately or as soon thereafter as Wish deems practicable.

Moreover, if Wish determines that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations or suspected violations of this Agreement, or other risks to Wish or third parties, or reflect pending or otherwise unrecoupable balances, then Wish may withhold and/or set off or offset any payments to you for as long as Wish determines such conditions or any related risks to Wish or third parties persist. For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (a) charge your account or any payment instrument you provide to us; (b) set off or offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement, converting balances in your account to Wish, or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (c) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (d) reverse any credits to you; or (e) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means, as applicable under Applicable Laws.

If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or other illegal activity, or to violate this Agreement, then we may permanently withhold and/or set off or offset and retain any payments that otherwise may have been payable to you. In addition, we may require that you pay other amounts to secure the performance of your obligations under this Agreement or to mitigate the risk of returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations or suspected violations of this Agreement, or other risks to Wish or third parties. These amounts may be refundable or nonrefundable in the manner we determine, which may include converting balances in your account to Wish, and failure to comply with this Agreement, including any applicable Policies, may result in their forfeiture.

4\. Appointment of Wish as Limited Payment Collection Agent
-----------------------------------------------------------

You hereby appoint Wish as your payment collection agent, solely for the limited purpose of accepting funds from Wish users who purchase items through the Services.

You agree that any funds resulting from a Wish user’s purchase of any product or service through the Services and received by Wish from a Wish user shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to you by a Wish user. You further agree that you will provide the purchased products or services to the Wish user in the agreed-upon manner as if you have received the payment directly from the Wish user. You agree that Wish may refund the Wish user in accordance with Wish’s [Return Policy](https://wish.com/return_policy). As stated above, you understand and agree that Wish’s obligation to pay you is subject to and conditioned upon successful receipt of the associated funds from Wish users who purchase items through the Services. Wish guarantees payments to you only for such amounts that have been successfully received by Wish from Wish users in accordance with this Agreement and Wish’s [Terms of Use](https://wish.com/terms) and that are not subject to refunds made to Wish users. In accepting appointment as your limited payment collection agent, Wish assumes no liability for any of your acts or omissions (including, without limitation, any violation by you of this Agreement or any Applicable Laws).

You agree that any obligation of a Wish user to pay you for the purchase of any products or services through the Services is extinguished upon the Wish user’s payment of the funds to Wish, upon which Wish then is responsible for remitting the funds to you in the manner described in this Agreement, the [Fees and Payments](https://merchant.wish.com/policy/fees_and_payments) Policy, or as otherwise communicated by Wish to you. Your funds are not eligible for payment to you unless and until all terms in this Agreement, the [Fees and Payments](https://merchant.wish.com/policy/fees_and_payments) Policy, and Wish’s [Terms of Use](https://wish.com/terms) are satisfied. In the event that Wish does not remit any such payment or funds to you, you will have recourse only against Wish and not the Wish user directly.

You agree that Wish may honor any governmental or judicial order attaching, garnishing, or levying upon funds otherwise payable to you hereunder and that any payment to a governmental authority or a third party pursuant to a court order by Wish as required by such order shall relieve Wish of any obligation to pay such funds to you.

You further agree that Wish shall have no obligation to invest such funds for your account and that you shall not be entitled to any interest earned on such funds while such funds are in the possession of Wish.

Wish shall have the right to offset its obligation to pay you such funds to satisfy any obligation then owing by you to Wish. Wish shall otherwise have no interest in the funds that it holds for you as paying agent, and any liability for taxation or otherwise related to such funds shall be entirely yours.

Wish will disburse funds owed hereunder to you upon your written instruction and shall have the right to rely on such written instruction. Under no circumstance shall Wish be obligated to advance to you funds it does not hold as your paying agent.

Wish reserves the right to resign as your paying agent and cancel your account at any time.

5\. Listing and Selling
-----------------------

Listing Description: By listing any product or service on the Services, you warrant that you and all aspects of such product or service comply with this Agreement (including all Additional Terms and Policies) and other published policies, and relevant Applicable Laws. You also warrant that you may legally sell or provide such product or service in all locations that you list your product or service for sale. You are solely responsible for accurately describing your products and services and all terms of sale in your Wish shop. Your listings may only include content relevant to the sale of that product or service. All products and services must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags. Each listing must truthfully, accurately, and completely describe the product(s) or service(s) for sale in that listing. If the “in stock” quantity is more than one, all products in that listing must be identical. Wish does not have any responsibility for, or obligations related to, the descriptions of your products or services.

Shop Policies: Wish may permit you, in certain circumstances, to outline shop policies for your Wish shop. These policies may include, for example, shipping, returns, payment, and selling policies. You must create reasonable policies in good faith and must abide at all times in compliance with such policies. You are prohibited from creating any policies that are deceptive or inaccurate. All shop policies must comply with Wish’s respective Additional Terms and Policies and all Applicable Laws. You are solely responsible for reviewing Wish’s Policies to ensure that your shop policies remain in compliance with Wish’s Policies and for ensuring that your shop policies remain in compliance with all Applicable Laws. You are responsible for enforcing your own shop policies. In the event of conflict between your shop policies and the Terms or any other Wish Additional Terms or Policies, the Terms or the appropriate Wish Additional Terms or Policies shall control as it relates to your use of the Services.

Binding Sale: All sales are binding. You agree to all applicable provisions related to sales as outlined in the Additional Terms and Policies. You are obligated to ship the applicable order in a prompt manner after a sale is made over the Services or you otherwise complete the transaction with the applicable buyer. The cost arising from not completing orders in time shall be undertaken by you.

Third Party Service Providers: To the extent you use any third party to assist or facilitate any portion of your use of the Services, including, without limitation, your listings, sales, fulfillment, system notifications or changes, customer support, or other functions, you agree that you shall be responsible for, and Wish shall not be liable for, any acts, conduct, errors, omissions, losses, claims, or other issues resulting from your use of such third party’s services.

Fee Avoidance: The price stated in each product or service listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. You may charge reasonable shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and mailing products. You may not charge excessive shipping fees or otherwise avoid fees. You may not do anything intended to avoid or having the effect of avoiding any fees due to Wish, or otherwise intended to violate this Agreement, including, without limitation, altering a product’s or service’s price after a sale, misrepresenting the location of a product or service, using another merchant’s account without permission, or arranging a sale outside of the Wish platform to avoid paying fees to Wish.

Nonconformity, Defects, or Other Issues with Items: You understand and agree that Wish is not the seller of any product or service you list for sale, and that Wish has no control over and does not give any commitment relating to the existence, quality, safety, genuineness, legality, or any other aspect of such product or service, the truth or accuracy of any information or materials you provide to Wish or make available to Wish customers related to such product or service, the ability of a Wish customer to pay for the product or service, or whether the Wish customer may return or seek a refund or cancellation for such product or service, and you further understand and agree that Wish will have no liability related to your product or service. You are also responsible for any nonconformity or defect in, or any recall (public or private, voluntary or mandatory) of, as well as any other safety concerns related to, the products or services you list for sale. You will notify Wish as soon as you become aware of, or reasonably suspect, any nonconformity or defect in or safety concerns or recall related to your products. If we determine that the performance of your obligations under this Agreement may result in returns, claims, disputes, or violations of this Agreement, or cause any other risks to us or third parties, then we may mitigate them, including by determining whether a customer will receive a refund, adjustment, or replacement for any of your products or services for as long as we determine any related risks to us or third parties persist. If you offer a product for sale through our Services that requires a warning under California Health & Safety Code Section 25249.6 (a “Proposition 65 Warning”), you (a) will provide in your listing such warning in the manner compliant with Applicable Laws, (b) agree that our display of a Proposition 65 Warning on a product detail page is confirmation of our receipt of that warning, and (c) will only revise or remove a Proposition 65 Warning for a product when the prior warning is no longer legally required.

No Transfer of Title: In no event shall title to any products transfer to Wish, even if Wish takes possession of a product in connection with any sale, product return, or disposition of abandoned products, including any products that are not retrieved by a customer for more than fifteen (15) days as set forth below.

Customer Support: Wish may provide you with a mode by which you may receive and respond to inquiries from Wish users, including questions about product issues, shipping, delivery, returns, and refunds. In such event, you understand and agree that Wish may establish certain service-level agreements (“SLAs”) related to your responses (e.g., timing to respond, types of permitted communications with customers, etc.) to which you will be required to adhere.

You further agree that Wish, in its sole discretion (and including in the event you do not respond in accordance with an SLA), also may, but is not obligated to, provide support to customers as a service to you, including with respect to complaint intake and answering questions about logistics (including shipping, delivery, returns, and refunds), without taking title to any products, and provision of such support shall not, and shall not be deemed to, transfer title to Wish.

Disposition of Returned and Abandoned Products: Any products that are returned to or not retrieved from any local store, warehouse, or other facility of Wish or any of its other merchants, agents, or third party providers, including any customer product orders made as part of the Wish Local program as set forth in the [Wish Local Participant Terms and Conditions](https://wish.com/local/terms) (including, but not limited to, Wish Pickup, home delivery, or curbside pickup) that are not retrieved for more than thirty (30) days after the product is delivered to the designated Wish Local location, shall be deemed abandoned. Upon such abandonment, Wish, directly or through its designee, shall have the right to take possession of and relist, sell, donate, recycle, destroy, or otherwise dispose of any such abandoned products. Except as specifically set forth below with respect to any such abandoned products that are relisted or sold by Wish, title to each such disposed product will transfer to Wish or a third party it selects (such as a charity), at no cost to Wish or such third party, free and clear of any liens, claims, security interests, or other encumbrances to the extent required to dispose of the product, and Wish shall have the right to retain any proceeds Wish may receive from such disposal and to withhold and/or set off or offset any payments to you for all costs incurred by Wish in connection with such disposal.

Should Wish relist or sell any such abandoned product, Merchant understands and agrees that, for any relisted or sold product: (a) Wish shall not, and in no way be deemed to, take legal title to such product, (b) should Wish then complete a subsequent sale of such product, Merchant will not receive any payment beyond any payment that Merchant had been eligible to receive and already received for such product, and (c) Wish may use the same product listing, Merchant identification, and any other information previously used by Merchant in connection with any relisting or other disposition of any product for such product.

AS APPLICABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, WISH DISCLAIMS ANY DUTIES OF A BAILEE OR WAREHOUSEMAN, AND YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF A BAILOR ARISING UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAWS (WHETHER ARISING UNDER COMMON LAW, CIVIL LAW, STATUE, OR OTHERWISE) RELATING TO ANY POSSESSION, STORAGE, SHIPMENT, OR DISPOSAL OF YOUR PRODUCTS BY WISH, OUR AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF OUR OR THEIR DESIGNEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS.

Disposition of Products in Compliance with Legal Requirement: Wish, directly or through its designee, shall have the right to take possession and dispose of products to comply with any Applicable Laws or any order or other requirement of any court, arbitrator, or other governmental authority and to withhold and/or set off or offset any payments to you for all costs incurred by Wish in connection with such disposal. Such action shall not, and shall not be deemed to, transfer title to Wish.

Third Party Platforms: Wish has or may enter into relationships with third parties that support the marketing, sale, and fulfillment of any Merchant’s products and services through such third parties’ platforms and applications or channels of trade (“Third Party Platforms”), either as part of, or as a separate offering from, the Services. You acknowledge and agree that Wish may, and you hereby expressly authorize Wish to, market, promote, publish, display, offer for sale, sell, or fulfill your products and services through any Third Party Platform, whether as part of the Services or separate from the Services, whether concurrently with or in lieu of the Services, or whether you are required to create an account with any Third Party Platform.

Other: Wish generally strives for equal treatment of the Wish merchants. However, Wish might differentiate merchants for reasons including the following: (i) products offered by Wish merchants that participate in the paid [ProductBoost](https://merchant.wish.com/product-boost) service might be favored due to economic and commercial reasons; (ii) products offered by merchants with high ratings may be favored over those offered by merchants with lower ratings; (iii) products offered by merchants with low refund rates may be favored over those offered by merchants with higher refund rates; (iv) products offered by merchants in regions in close proximity to a Wish customer may be favored over products offered outside those regions; (v) products offered by Wish or its Affiliated companies might be favored for economic and commercial reasons; (vi) products whose merchants offer faster shipping options may be favored over products whose merchants offer slower shipping options; (vii) products whose merchants offer lower prices may be favored over merchants offering the same product for more; (viii) the length of relationship between Wish and its merchants; or (ix) the nature of the product sold or the volume of sales by the Wish merchant. Favored treatment may include scenarios such as higher position in rankings; increased direct or indirect remuneration to the merchant for use of the Services; or other merchandising support. Wish encourages its merchants to provide Wish customers with the fastest shipping options and lowest prices possible.

Wish product listings, including those resulting from user searches, are ranked according to various factors. These factors are determined solely by Wish, are designed to help ensure that Wish customers see the items that they might find most relevant, and, in addition to the foregoing bases for differentiating between merchants, may also consider a Wish customer’s prior engagement with Wish, a Wish customer’s prior orders and search history, the terms used in a Wish customer’s search query, Wish’s attempts to expand and understand the appeal or interest in new product categories or offerings, a Wish customer’s location, the Wish merchant’s rating, the historical revenue per impression of the product or service listing, the Wish merchant’s refund rate, whether a Wish merchant participates in the paid [ProductBoost](https://merchant.wish.com/product-boost) service (which participation might increase the ranking of a merchant’s listing), and the overall standing of the Wish merchant on the Wish platform.

You acknowledge and agree that, as part of the Services provided to you, Wish may use its algorithms, know-how, and other systems to set the final price of each item shown to a Wish customer. This final price may be lower, higher, or the same as the listing price you provide, and you acknowledge and agree that Wish may retain any amounts collected from Wish customers that exceed your or any other merchant’s listing price.

8\. Arbitration
---------------

You and Wish understand and agree that this arbitration section operates as a separate and distinct arbitration agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”) that is severable from the remainder of this Agreement and is enforceable regardless of the enforceability of any other provision of the Agreement. Consideration for this provision includes, without limitation, the parties’ mutual agreement to arbitrate claims. As noted above, this agreement to arbitrate shall survive any termination, cancellation, or expiration of the Agreement.

You and Wish agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to your use of Wish, to any products or services sold or distributed by or through Wish, to the Agreement, or to the Content, or user submissions (public, personal, or limited audience) on Wish, shall be resolved only by final and binding, bilateral arbitration, subject to the exceptions below.

You and Wish agree that this Arbitration Agreement shall govern all questions as to whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.

“Disputes” shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies between you and Wish against each other related in any way to or arising in any way out of or from the Agreement, the Services, the Content, Submissions (public, personal, or limited audience), including, but not limited to, sales, payments, returns, refunds, cancellations, defects, policies (including violations or suspected violations thereof), fulfilment, privacy, advertising, or any communications between you and Wish, even if the claim arises after you or Wish has terminated the Services or a user account. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you bring against our employees, agents, Affiliates, or other representatives; or (b) that Wish brings against you. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and Wish, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, warranty, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before the Agreement or out of prior Agreement(s) with Wish; (iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation; or (iv) claims that arise after the termination of the Agreement.

### 8.1 Initial Dispute Resolution

Most Disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration. In the event of a Dispute, you and Wish each agree to first provide the other a written notice (“Notice of Dispute”), which shall contain: (a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information; (b) a statement of the specific relief sought; and (c) the contact information of the party giving it. A Notice of Dispute must be sent to: One Sansome Street, San Francisco, CA 94104 or emailed at [merchant\_notices@wish.com](mailto:merchant_notices@wish.com). Wish will provide a Notice of Dispute to you via the email address associated with your Wish User ID, Merchant ID, or other information provided to Wish by you.

You and Wish agree to use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute through consultation with one another, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or Wish may commence an arbitration proceeding.

Except as provided below, no party shall be entitled to commence or maintain any action in a court of law upon any matter in dispute until such matter has been submitted and determined as provided here, and then only for the enforcement of such arbitration award. Notwithstanding this mediation and arbitration policy, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to ensure that the relief sought in arbitration is not rendered ineffectual during the pendency of, or after the rendition of, a decision in any arbitration proceeding. The institution of any action shall not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any claim seeking relief other than injunctive or enforcement relief to arbitration. Further, any party seeking to enforce an award of an arbitrator shall submit the award under seal to maintain protections of confidential information, and you and Wish hereby agree and consent to the filing of such a submission, motion, or order under seal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Services shall not be subject to arbitration, and the notice and good-faith negotiation required by this Section shall not apply to those types of Disputes.

### 8.2 Binding Arbitration Process and Procedure

Except as provided herein, any Dispute will be finally resolved only by binding arbitration.

Any arbitration will be filed with and administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) under its rules and procedures, which are available at the ICC website. If the ICC is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If there is a conflict between the ICC rules (or the rules of the alternative arbitral forum selected by the parties) and the rules set forth in this Arbitration Agreement, the rules set forth in this Arbitration Agreement will govern.

Notwithstanding the rules of the ICC, the following will apply to all arbitration actions:

* The Arbitration Agreement and the arbitration will be governed by Dutch Laws.
    
* The arbitration will be conducted in English.
    
* The parties agree that time is of the essence.
    
* The arbitration will take place in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
    
* The parties will be allotted equal time to present their respective cases, including cross-examinations.
    

In addition to the foregoing and notwithstanding the rules of the ICC, certain procedures will apply depending on the amount in controversy. For controversies and claims in which the amount in controversy is less than five million (5,000,000) dollars, the following procedures will apply:

* The arbitration will occur within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date on which the arbitrator is appointed and will last no more than five (5) business days.
    
* There will be one (1) arbitrator selected from the panel provided by the ICC, using the ICC rules for arbitrator selection.
    

For controversies and claims in which the amount in controversy is equal to or exceeds five million (5,000,000) dollars, the following procedures will apply:

* There will be three (3) arbitrators selected from the panel provided by the ICC, using the ICC rules for arbitrator selection.
    

If Wish’s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of ten thousand (10,000) dollars or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing under the ICC rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.

You or Wish may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court with jurisdiction and venue over you if Wish otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief. However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Wish with advance notice by email to [merchant\_notices@wish.com](mailto:merchant_notices@wish.com) and by U.S. Mail to General Counsel, ContextLogic Inc., One Sansome Street, 33rd Fl., San Francisco, CA 94104.

To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Wish will pay the additional cost. Wish shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expert witness costs unless Wish is specifically required to pay such fees under Applicable Laws.

This Agreement, including this Arbitration Agreement, does not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any relevant government agency. Such agencies can, if the Applicable Laws allow, seek relief against Wish on your behalf.

The parties agree and understand that maintaining confidentiality of Disputes and Dispute resolution is of the utmost importance and agree that Wish has valuable trade secrets and proprietary and confidential information. The parties agree to take all necessary steps to protect from public disclosure such trade secrets and proprietary and confidential information.

### 8.3 Authority of Arbitrator

The arbitrator has the authority to determine jurisdiction and arbitrability issues as a preliminary matter, except the arbitrator shall not have the authority to determine whether the arbitration can proceed on behalf of or against a class. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Wish.

The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties.

The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or Dispute.

The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages available to an individual under Applicable Laws, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement), except that the arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive damages. Each party hereby waives any right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any Dispute resolved by arbitration, except where an applicable statute or other law allows for punitive damages.

The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any nonmonetary remedy or relief available to an individual under Applicable Laws, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).

The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the Applicable Laws. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

### 8.4 Parents, Subsidiaries, Affiliates

This Arbitration Agreement will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary, or Affiliate of Wish, or any employee, officer, director, or investor of Wish, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to this Agreement (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Services, any person’s access to or use of the Services, or the provision of Content, products, services, or technology on or through the Services.

### 8.5 Changes to This Arbitration Section

Wish reserves the right to amend the Arbitration Agreement. In that instance, Wish will provide thirty (30) days’ advance notice of any such amendment if required by law to do so. The notice will be provided via electronic mail, the Wish Merchant Dashboard, the Wish API, or other commercially reasonable means. With regard to any such amendment, you agree that the continuation of your use of the Services, after receipt of the notice of such amendment, shall constitute your acknowledgement and acceptance of any and all such changes, and it shall also constitute adequate consideration to support such change(s), which shall automatically be incorporated into this Arbitration Agreement as of the effective date stated in the amendment.

Unless otherwise permitted by Applicable Laws, you agree that any amendment will only apply to Disputes that arise after the effective date of such amendment unless you have expressly agreed to such amendment.

Prior to the effective date of such proposed amendment, you may opt out of any proposed amendment by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: General Counsel, ContextLogic Inc., One Sansome Street, 33rd Fl., San Francisco, CA 94104, or by email to [merchant\_notices@wish.com](mailto:merchant_notices@wish.com). Wish may terminate the Agreement of any Merchant who does not agree to a proposed amendment to this Section 8.

### 8.6 Severability

Subject to Section 9, titled “Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions,” if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

### 8.7 Survival of Arbitration Agreement

This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement or your relationship with Wish.

9\. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions
-------------------------------------------

Wish and you agree that any Dispute will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Wish and you further agree to not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising out of or relating to any dispute with a third party.

The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s or entity’s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise). And the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s or entity’s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Wish users, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.

If any clause within this Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this Section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.

This Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions Section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary, or Affiliate of Wish, or any employee, officer, director, or investor of Wish, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claim is a Dispute.

This Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions Section shall survive any termination of your account or the Services.

Wish may try to help you resolve disputes with third parties. Wish does so in Wish’s sole discretion, and Wish has no obligation to resolve disputes between you and other users or between you and outside parties. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users or other outside parties, you release Wish, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from any and all claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes or our Services.

Please note that this clause may not be applicable, especially in European Union or the United Kingdom jurisdictions that do not have class or consolidated action options.

If Wish has posted or provided a translation of the English language version of this Agreement, you agree that the translation is provided for convenience only and that the English language version will govern your uses of the Services or the Sites.

14\. Liability Limit
--------------------

Parties are only liable for damages suffered as a result of fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence.

In case of minor negligence, the parties are only liable for (a) injury to life, body, or health; or (b) foreseeable typically occurring damages resulting from the breach of a fundamental contractual obligation, as applicable under Applicable Laws.

Certain jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to you despite Section 28 of this Agreement, the above applies only to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

15\. Indemnity
--------------

To the fullest extent allowed by Applicable Laws, you release us and agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Wish, its Affiliates, and its officers, agents, employees, customers, users, licensors, suppliers, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, investigations, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses, penalties, costs, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to (a) your actual or alleged breach of any representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations in this Agreement; (b) your products, services, or Content, including, without limitation, any actual or alleged infringement or other violation of any intellectual property or other proprietary rights, violation of any privacy right, right of publicity, or third party agreement, violation of any Applicable Laws, personal injury, death, or property damage related thereto, use of any reposting of any Content you provide, and Wish’s exercise of the license rights granted to Wish under this Agreement; (c) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account); (d) your acts and omissions; and (e) Your Taxes (as defined below). Wish may in its sole discretion elect to defend, and control the defense and settlement of, any indemnified claim. If you defend any indemnified claim, you will use counsel reasonably satisfactory to us to defend such indemnified claim. If at any time we reasonably determine that any indemnified claim might adversely affect us, we may take control of the defense. You may not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of a claim without our prior written consent. Wish may deduct from your account any amounts incurred in defending or settling any indemnified claim and any damages or other amounts awarded in connection with any indemnified claim.

To the fullest extent allowed by Applicable Laws, we release you and agree to indemnify, defend, and hold you, your officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, investigations, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses, penalties, costs, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related our noncompliance with Applicable Laws.

“Your Taxes” means any and all sales, goods and services, use, excise, premium, import, export, value-added, consumption, and other taxes, regulatory fees, levies (specifically including environmental levies), or charges and duties assessed, incurred, or required to be collected or paid for any reason in connection with your use of the Services, any advertisement, offer or sale of products, services, or Content by you on or through or in connection with the Services. This defined term also means any of the types of taxes, duties, levies, or fees mentioned above that are imposed on or collectible by Wish or any of its Affiliates in connection with or as a result of fulfillment services, including the storage of inventory or packaging of products, services, or Content and other materials owned by you and stored by Wish, shipping, or other actions by Wish. “Your Taxes”, however, does not include any taxes collected and remitted by Wish as disclosed in the [Tax Policy](https://merchant.wish.com/tax/policy).

16\. Insurance
--------------

If requested by Wish, within thirty (30) days after such request, you will maintain at your expense throughout the remainder of the Term general commercial, umbrella, or excess liability insurance with the limits per occurrence and in aggregate requested by us covering liabilities caused by or occurring in conjunction with the operation of your business, including products, products/completed operations, and bodily injury, with a policy or policies naming Wish and its Affiliates and assignees as additional insureds. At our request, you will provide to us certificates of insurance for the coverage.

17\. Taxes; Legal Compliance
----------------------------

As between the parties, you will be responsible for the collection, reporting, and payment of any and all of Your Taxes, except to the extent that Wish chooses or is required to calculate, collect, and remit taxes according to Applicable Laws.

Notwithstanding or limiting in any way the foregoing, you shall comply with all Applicable Laws regarding your use of any of the Services and, if applicable, your listing, solicitation of offers to purchase, and sale of items. In addition, you will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that Wish may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.

For direct shipments from outside the European Union to customers in the European Union, Wish may provide you with its Import One Stop Shop (''IOSS'') number. You understand and agree that you will only use this IOSS number in relation to sales carried out via the Wish online marketplace. If you use the IOSS number of Wish inappropriately in any way, Wish may, at its sole discretion, withhold or offset retaining amounts otherwise due to you, issue a penalty, suspend your account, or take any other actions Wish deems appropriate for so long as Wish in its sole discretion believes that you used the Wish IOSS number in an inappropriate way. Inappropriate usage of the IOSS number includes, but is not limited to, the following scenarios:

* you use the IOSS number of Wish for shipments related to sales carried out outside the Wish online platform (for instance, where you sell and ship goods to a customer in the European Union via another online marketplace);
    
* you do not transmit the Wish IOSS VAT number to your freight forwarder in a secure manner;
    
* you communicate the Wish IOSS VAT number to other persons; or
    
* you publish the Wish IOSS VAT number anywhere (for example an internet website).
    

18\. Customs Duty and Indirect Taxes
------------------------------------

In an effort to remain compliant with respective consumer legislations, we strongly encourage you to maintain good standing with respect to customs and indirect taxes, where applicable.

Due to separate and applicable tax jurisdictions, purchases may be subject to specific sales, customs duty, goods and services taxes (GST), or value-added taxes (VAT), and the shipping time and associated cost may increase.

In an effort to maintain compliance with U.S. or international tax law, Wish may require you to provide a valid indirect tax registration number to sell on our marketplace, and you may be required to remit indirect taxes as the result of conducting business. As a result, we strongly encourage you to consult your own tax experts and register for indirect taxes based on your acts and circumstances.

You agree that you are responsible for all indirect tax collection and payment among all parties of this Agreement, unless Wish chooses to collect and remit tax as disclosed in its [Tax Policy](https://merchant.wish.com/tax/policy) and in compliance with Applicable Laws.

19\. Severability
-----------------

If any provision of this Agreement is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the parties’ intention. All remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

20\. Survival
-------------

Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of this Agreement shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any confidentiality obligations, any terms regarding Wish’s ownership or intellectual property rights, or any terms regarding Disputes between us. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.

21\. Export
-----------

You will not directly or indirectly export, re-export, transmit, or cause to be exported, re-exported or transmitted, any commodities, software or technology to any country, individual, corporation, organization, or entity to which such export, re-export, or transmission is restricted or prohibited, including any country, individual, corporation, organization, or entity under Sanctions or embargoes administered by the United Nations, the U.S. Departments of State, Treasury, or Commerce, the European Union, the United Kingdom, or any other applicable government authority.
