Effective Date: **26 January 2018**

Last Updated Date: **13 August 2018**

#### Introduction and Eligibility

Please read these Terms of Use (“**Terms**“) carefully before using the Service.

These Terms include ViaVan’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.viavan.com/privacy-policy/), which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. We have included several annotations in boxes to help explain or emphasize key sections. These annotations are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

This agreement is a legally binding contract. It may change (in accordance with the provisions below) as our business changes, and you agree you will review it and any updates regularly. **Your continued use of the Service means you accept any changes.**

**Binding Agreement.** These Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and ViaVan Technologies B.V. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“**ViaVan**,” “**Company**,” “**we**,” “**us**”). “**You**” and “**users**” shall mean all users of the Service. You accept these Terms each time you access the Service. If you do not accept these Terms, you must not use the Service. If you are under 18 years of age, you represent and agree that you possess the legal consent of your parent or guardian to access and use the Service.

**Revisions to Terms.** We reserve the right to revise these Terms at any time by posting an updated version to the extent the changes do not affect our ongoing contractual obligations and the main characteristics of the Service. If changes affect our ongoing legal obligations and/or the main characteristics of the Service, we will inform you in advance via email. If you do not object by the deadline provided in the e-mail, you will become bound by the updated Terms.

The terms “**post**” and “**posting**” as used in these Terms shall mean the act of submitting, transmitting, sharing, uploading, publishing, displaying, or similar action on the Service.

#### The Service

The “**Service**” means any website, mobile application, or Internet service under ViaVan’s control, whether partial or otherwise, in connection with providing ViaVan’s online platform that enables users to connect with vehicle-sharing transportation providers in major cities. Each reservation a user makes with such vehicle-sharing transportation providers on the Service is a “**Reservation**,” and each ride taken through a Reservation is a “**Ride**.” In determining the fees for and accepting your requests for reservations we act on behalf of the transportation providers and not for riders.

YOU AGREE THAT VIAVAN DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND IS NOT A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER. WE MERELY ACT AS THE COMMERCIAL AGENT OF THE THIRD-PARTY TRANSPORTATION PROVIDER, DRIVER, OR VEHICLE OPERATOR IN OFFERING TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS PARTY TO PROVIDE THE TRANSPORTATION SERVICE WHICH MAY BE RESERVED THROUGH OUR SERVICE. VIAVAN OFFERS INFORMATION AND A MEANS OF ACCESS TO SUCH THIRD-PARTY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, BUT DOES NOT AND DOES NOT INTEND TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES OR ACT IN ANY WAY AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.

By using the Service to make a Reservation for a Ride, unless you are choosing the “Private” option (if applicable and available) you are electing to use a ridesharing transportation service. You may arrange for individual (i.e., non-shared) transportation services by contacting a third-party transportation provider directly. Please be aware that the fees for such individual transportation are set by the third-party transportation providers and may differ substantially from the fees for the Service.

The Service is currently being offered as a beta test, and as such is limited in its capacity, geographic region, and hours of operation. The geographic region and hours of operation were selected based on the Service’s limited capacity during the beta test and our anticipation of demand for the Service and have no discriminatory rationale or intention. We anticipate expanding the Service to a broader geographic area and/or additional hours of operation in the future. Should you have any recommendations for additional times and/or areas of service, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.viavan.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

#### Eligibility to Use the Service

**Children.** No part of the Service is directed to persons under the age of 16. IF YOU ARE UNDER 16 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. Children under the age of 16 are only allowed to participate on a Ride when accompanied with a guardian, parent or other adult who has registered for the Services in a legally valid manner.

No one under the age of 18 is allowed to register with or use the Service without the consent of a parent or guardian. If you are under the age of 18, by registering for and using the Service, you warrant and represent that you have consent to do so from a parent or guardian. If you are a parent or guardian of a minor who has registered for or used the Service without your consent, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.viavan.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

1. are an authorized representative of that Organization;
2. have the authority to bind that Organization to these Terms; and

Your account is personal to you, and you may not share your account information with, or allow access to your account by, any third party. As you will be responsible for all activity that occurs under your access credentials (including, without limitation, the behavior of any other people that travel in your party), you agree to use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Service and to preserve the confidentiality of your username and password, and any device that you use to access the Service.

You agree to notify us immediately of any breach in secrecy of your log-in information. If you have any reason to believe that your account information has been compromised or that your account has been accessed by a third party, you agree to immediately notify the Company by e-mail to [\[email protected\]](https://www.viavan.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). You will be solely responsible for the losses incurred by the Company and others due to any unauthorized use of your account.

#### Payments and Billing

ViaVan charges a fee (the “**Fee**”) for use of the Service. You will be charged when your Ride is complete, provided that we may pre-authorize and hold an estimated amount of the Fee on your card before the Ride begins. Your payment to us as the commercial agent of the transportation provider will discharge your obligation to the transportation provider in respect of the Fee. All Fees are non-refundable. Fees include any applicable VAT. Fees are exclusive of other taxes or government surcharges.

**No termination Allowed.** After placing the Reservation, termination is not possible based on articles 6:230p sub d and 230p sub e of the Dutch Civil Code.

**Cancellation Policy.**  If you cancel a Reservation, we may charge you a cancelation fee as indicated [here](http://support.ridewithvia.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1810901-how-much-does-a-ride-cost-). Repeated cancellations may result in the suspension of your account, in ViaVan’s sole discretion.

**No-Show Policy.** If you are not present at the time and place designated in your Reservation, we may charge you a no-show fee as indicated [here](http://support.ridewithvia.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1810901-how-much-does-a-ride-cost-). Repeated “no-show” instances may result in the suspension of your account, in ViaVan’s sole discretion.

**Cleaning/Damage Fees. If the interior or exterior of your driver’s vehicle is damaged or dirtied as a result of intentional or negligent acts such as aggressive slamming of doors, vomiting, or pet accidents, an additional cleaning or damage Fee may be assessed and charged.**

**ViaVan Credits and Promotional Codes.** You may purchase credit (“**ViaVan Credit**”) towards future Rides. Purchases of ViaVan Credit are non-refundable and may only be used with the Service. ViaVan may offer promotional codes with varying features and rates that are redeemable for ViaVan Credit. Any such promotional code is valid until its stated expiration date.

#### Additional Guests

If you make a Reservation and multiple people are traveling in your party, you, as the account associated with the Reservation, are responsible for the conduct of everybody traveling in your party.

When you make a Reservation, you must indicate how many people are travelling in your party. If you do not, we reserve the right to refuse service to additional guests or charge an additional Fee.

#### Disputes, applicable law and competent court

Any and all disputes or claims of any kind between you and ViaVan arising out of or relating to your use of the Service or these Terms will be resolved with use of arbitration. ViaVan shall be entitled to apply to any court worldwide for injunctive or other remedies in order to protect its confidential information and/or intellectual property.

These Terms and the relationship between you and ViaVan shall be governed by the laws of the Netherlands without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The arbitration will be under the Arbitration Rules of the Netherlands Arbitration Institute. Arbitration will take place before a single arbitrator. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. Consolidation of the arbitral proceedings with other arbitral proceedings, as provided for in Article 1046 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure and Article 39 of the Arbitration Rules of the Netherlands Arbitration Institute, is excluded.

The courts of the Netherlands shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement.

The arbitrator’s award or decision will be final and binding on the parties.  Each party in the arbitration will be responsible for its own legal fees, costs, and expenses, subject to the arbitrator’s authority to award legal fees to a prevailing party if expressly permitted by the law under which the dispute arises.

Arbitration shall be the sole, exclusive, and final remedy with respect to all disputes provided that you have not lodged an objection and given notice that you claim the right of settlement of the dispute by the court with jurisdiction pursuant to the law within one month after ViaVan has invoked this arbitration clause.
