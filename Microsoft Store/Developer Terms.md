for Certification. If your intended distribution of Apps or In-App Products through the Microsoft

Store is in relation to your business, trade, or profession, your Store Account must be a Company

account type. By choosing an Individual or Company account type during the Store Account sign-

up process, you thereby declare such status. Please review additional information on Store

Account account types at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-

us/windows/apps/publish/partner-center/account-types-locations-and-fees. Microsoft will use

the email address associated with your Store Account to inform you about updates, changes, or

issues regarding your Store Account, Apps and In-App Products, this Agreement, and other

information. It is your responsibility to ensure that such contact information is kept current. You

agree that Microsoft may publicly display in the Store the email address that you provide in

5



Partner Center for customer support purposes. Your Store Account is only for use by you and the

individuals you authorize as your delegates in Partner Center. You are responsible for all activity

that takes place with your Store Account. You may not share your user name and password or

otherwise authorize any third party (other than your authorized delegate(s)) to access or use the

Store and/or Partner Center on your behalf. If you fail to keep your Store Account in good

standing (for example, by failing to pay fees, if any, associated with the Store Account, by giving

Microsoft incorrect or outdated information, by failing to provide any required tax information, by

engaging in dishonest or fraudulent activity, by failing to maintain an active state in the Store

catalog, or by repeatedly submitting Apps or In-App Products that violate this Agreement

(including any requirements in the Documentation), abusing the Store service, or interfering with

any other party's use of the Store service) Microsoft may revoke your Store Account, remove your

Apps and In-App Products from the Store, delete App ratings and reviews, retain associated

Account Fees (if any), and pursue any other remedies available to Microsoft (including, where

appropriate, the retention of any App Proceeds otherwise owed to you). In deciding whether to

take such actions, Microsoft will consider the severity of any violations, number of previous

violations, proportionality of violations to other Store activity, and the fundamental rights of all

parties involved. When Microsoft revokes or suspends your Store Account you will receive a

written notice of such revocation or suspension that provides you with an opportunity to respond

to Microsoft and ask for reinstatement of your Store Account. All such reinstatement requests

should be sent to the following internal complaint-handling address: reportapp@microsoft.com.



3. SUBMISSION, EVALUATION, CERTIFICATION, AND DISTRIBUTION OF APPS.



a. Submission. You must submit to Microsoft each App and the metadata for

each In-App Product that you wish to make available through the Store, including any updates to

each App. You are solely responsible and liable for the App and In-App Products you submit. You

are responsible for supporting your App and for delivering and supporting your In -App

Products. Microsoft will retain (or destroy) all copies of the App and other materials you submit.

Microsoft will not return them, so you must maintain your own backup copies.



b. Updates to Apps. You may submit updates to Apps for Certification and

distribution through the Store. Those updates are subject to all of the requirements of this

Agreement. You understand that end users may elect to receive updates automatically. You may

not add any new functionality to your App via an update which requires written consent from the

Customer without first providing notice to the Customer and obtaining any consents as may be

required by law in the markets where you choose to distribute your App.



c. Evaluation and Testing.



i. Testing. You may use the Windows App Certification Kit, available

at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=221807, to test your

App on Windows 8, Windows 10, or successor operating system.



ii. Side-loading. If Microsoft offers a "device unlock" service, however

named, you may use such service to unlock a reasonable number

of Windows Devices, in accordance with any specifications and

technical limitations of the service, solely for the purpose of using

6



such unlocked Windows Devices to test and evaluate your Apps

and/or In-App Products. For purposes of this section, "unlock"

7



means to enable the Windows Device to load and run Apps and/or

In-App Products that are being developed for the Store.



d. Initial Certification. Microsoft will test each App (including any updates)

you submit for compliance with this Agreement (which includes the applicable Certification

Requirements) and other policies made available to you (if any). Microsoft will not make any

App available in the Store unless and until the App is Certified.



e. Content. You are solely responsible for selecting all content made

available through your App and In-App Product(s), including your App Assets, and for ensuring

that such content complies with the terms of this Agreement, the Certification Requirements,

and all applicable laws and regulations. Microsoft's Certification of an App does not constitute

any representation or acknowledgement by Microsoft that the App complies with such

requirements, nor does it constitute any acceptance by Microsoft of any responsibility or

liability in connection with such requirements.



f. Responding to Claims. If Microsoft receives a claim from a third party

requesting that your App be changed or removed, Microsoft may remove the App and/or refer

that claim to you. You must respond to the notice as soon as reasonably practicable, and

comply with any other requirements in Microsoft's Notice and Takedown policies at

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=224390. If you discover that your App violates the

terms of this Agreement, you must immediately notify Microsoft and work with Microsoft to

repair the App.



g. Making a Claim. If you believe another App violates your rights, you may

submit a claim to Microsoft in accordance with Microsoft's Notice and Takedown policies,

available at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=224390.

In-App Product that you submit or to maintain the availability of the App or In -App Product,

even if that App has been Certified.



i. App Placement and Promotion. Microsoft reserves the right, in its sole

discretion, to make (or to designate Affiliates or third parties to make) all decisions regarding

use your App Assets in connection with the manufacture, distribution, promotion, and marketing

of Promotional Codes. You may not offer or distribute Promotional Codes in any manner except

In-App Product and can be used by Customers to acquire content

Product as a way to promote and deliver your App or

game-related content (App or In-App Product), for Customer

retention programs and customer service.



iii. You forfeit revenue for your App or In-App Product if you give out

Promotional Codes.



iv. You shall not resell the Promotional Codes or get any payment for

them.



v. You shall distribute Promotional Codes only to Customers of the

appropriate age, corresponding to the Promotional Codes you

generate.



vi. Hidden content time limit: Premium content enabled through these

Promotional Codes must be made available to Customers on the

App within 60 days of release of the content.



k. Removal Policies. Microsoft may remove or suspend the availability of any

this Agreement or of the license grants associated with an App or In -App Product; (iii) an assertion

content or quality of your App or In-App Product, or (vii) your actual or potential violation of any

applicable law, regulation, or regulatory guideline. Microsoft also may disable previously

downloaded copies of an App or In-App Product if Microsoft believes that the App or In-App

Product could cause harm to end users or their devices, third parties (including any Covered

Parties) or any network, or to comply with any legal requirement, government order, or lawsuit

settlement. Unless your App or In-App Product that accrued App Proceeds is removed or disabled

for breach of the terms of this Agreement or the Documentation, or in response to an

infringement allegation, Microsoft will pay to you the amounts owed, if any, in connection with the

distribution of your App or In-App Product that accrued App Proceeds before removal or

disablement. Microsoft's termination and suspension rights are without prejudice to its other rights

and remedies.

l. Complaint Handling (Appeals). When Microsoft (i) terminates, removes or

suspends the availability of your Store Account, App, or In- App Product; (ii) declines to Certify

your App or In-App Product; or (iii) declines to remove or suspend the availability of a third

party’s Store Account, App, or In-App Product in response to a claim made by you in accordance

decision that provides you with the reasons for such decision by Microsoft and an opportunity to

ask Microsoft for reconsideration of the decision. All such appeals should be sent to the following

email address: reportapp@microsoft.com. Microsoft will conduct a diligent, objective, and

owner of the Microsoft Marks and associated goodwill, and the sole beneficiary of the goodwill

associated with your use of the Microsoft Marks. You will not acquire any right, title or interest in

the Microsoft Marks because of your use of the Microsoft Marks. You hereby assign and will assign

Microsoft Marks under this license, along with the associated goodwill. You will reasonably assist

d. In-App Commerce. You may elect to make In-App Product(s) available for

purchase from within your App. For any non-game In-App Products made available to Microsoft

Store customers on supported Windows devices (which excludes In-App Products made available

in non-game Apps on Xbox consoles) you may make use of a secure third-party commerce

engine to support the purchase of any In-App Product(s) that are or can be consumed or used

within your App. For: i) all Games and In-App Products in Games (including subscriptions)

available on any device and, ii) all Apps (and In-App Products made available in such Apps) made

16



available on Xbox consoles, you must use Microsoft’s commerce engine for the purchase of such

Game or App, or any In-App Products that are or can be consumed or used within such Game or

App.



e. Commerce Platform Requirements. Purchases made on a third-party

17



commerce engine are not subject to the Store Fee, but are still required to comply with our

Certification Requirements. Any in-app purchase functionality that you offer for purchase of any

product or service within your App must comply with the Certification Requirements. All

purchases using Microsoft's commerce engine will be subject to the terms of this Agreement,

including without limitation any terms regarding the Store Fee, Certification Requirements,

licensing requirements, and tax requirements. If your App allows any purchase to be made from

within the App you must prominently disclose in your product description that in-app purchase

functionality is available.



f. Xbox Live Services. If you elect to enable Xbox Live Services within your

App, you will submit your App through the Xbox certification process, and you must agree to

and comply with the terms and policies related to Xbox Live Services, available at

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=529963. You understand that enabling Xbox Live

Services may cause your App to collect Personal Information.

of your Apps on Microsoft Products (as defined in Exhibit D), you are subject to and agree to the

terms set forth in Exhibit D to this Agreement.



h. Subscriptions. You will fulfill any In-App Product offered on a subscription

basis during the entire subscription period as marketed and, in the event you breach this

section, you authorize Microsoft to refund to the Customer the full amount, plus taxes, if

applicable, or any portion thereof in Microsoft's sole discretion, of the price paid by the

Customer for that subscription offer. If you increase the subscription fee for a subscription that

is otherwise set to auto-renew, auto-renew will be disabled. You are responsible for accurately

describing all subscription offers and associated terms and conditions in accordance with

Section 5(b) and all applicable laws.



i. App Content Information. You are solely responsible for appropriately

identifying the content type for, and providing accurate information to, Microsoft with respect

to the Apps and In-App Products you make available in the Store.



6. APP PRICING, PAYMENTS, TRANSACTIONS AND TAXES.



a. App Pricing. When you submit an App or In-App Product, you will

designate the price (if any) to be charged to customers or Organizations by selecting one of the

price points that are consistent with the price points specified by Microsoft in the

Documentation for the applicable Store; and if your App uses the Microsoft commerce engine to

support purchase of the App or any In-App Purchases within the App, Microsoft will charge

Customers that price (or its reasonable equivalent in local currency) for the license to your App

or In-App Product as acquired through the Store. Except as otherwise provided in this

Agreement, you shall be solely responsible for all App and In-App pricing practices, which shall,

at a minimum, comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and regulatory guidance.



b. Store Fees. If your App uses the Microsoft commerce engine to support

purchase of the App or any In-App Purchases within the App, the Store Fee (plus any taxes

18



due in connection with the payment of such Store Fee, if applicable) you owe to Microsoft will

be deducted from Net Receipts to calculate the App Proceeds payable to you in accordance

with this Section 6. The Store Fee is:



i. Fifteen percent (15%) of Net Receipts for any Apps (and any In -App

Products in such Apps, including) that are not listed in Section 6(b)(iii)

below.

ii. For all Net Receipts generated on or after August 1, 2021: Twelve

percent (12%) of Net Receipts for any Games (and any in-App

Products in such Games) that are not listed in Section 6(b)(iii).



iii. Thirty percent (30%) of Net Receipts for:



1. all Xbox console Apps made available in the Microsoft Store and

billed to Customers on a non-subscription basis;



2. all Xbox console Games made available in the Microsoft Store



3. all In-App Products acquired on a non-subscription basis by

Customers in the Microsoft Store on an Xbox console and



4. all Apps and In-App Products acquired by Customers in the

Microsoft Store on Windows 8 devices; or Microsoft Store on

Windows Phone 8 devices.



c. Payment Terms and Processing. If your App uses the Microsoft

commerce engine to support purchase of the App or any In-App Purchases within the App,

Microsoft will pay you any applicable App Proceeds due and payable to you under this

Agreement in accordance with this Section 6(c). Payments generally occur on a monthly

basis and are subject to adjustment by Microsoft, if they meet the applicable thresholds

outlined in the Payment thresholds and methods section of Microsoft Partner Center

located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2199849. Microsoft will pay you any App

Proceeds in accordance with Microsoft's then-current payment policies and in the manner

you indicated during the Store Account setup. Microsoft is not responsible for delay or

misapplication of payment because of incorrect or incomplete information supplied by you

or a bank or for failure of a bank to credit your account. If you are outside of the United

States of America, Microsoft may remit payment to you in the local currency of your

address for payment, using Microsoft's then current rates for converting USD into or from

your local currency. The amount you actually receive will depend in part on the rates and

fees imposed by your financial institution and on any applicable tax withholding

requirements, and the amount you receive will be inclusive of any sales, use, goods and

services, value-added, or similar taxes that may be chargeable by you to Microsoft. You

must provide Microsoft (or its third- party payment processor) with all financial, tax and

banking information requested so Microsoft can pay you under this Agreement. Microsoft

will notify you of any changes to the required information via updates to the

Documentation. Your failure to keep such information current and accurate may result in

Microsoft's removal of your App or In-App

19



Product from the Store and forfeiture of amounts owed to you under this Agreement. A

Customer will be deemed to have paid in full for an App or In-App Product when Microsoft

receives payment from the Customer, and any failure by Microsoft to remit the amounts

owing to you will not affect a Customer's rights to an App or In -App Product.



d. Retaining Costs. If Microsoft removes your App or In-App Product from the

Store and/or any Customer's device(s) for breach of this Agreement or in response to an

allegation of intellectual property infringement, Microsoft may deduct any costs incurred in

connection with the removal of such App or In-App Product from any App Proceeds, if any. If

Microsoft terminates or suspends your Store Account for breach of this Agreement, Microsoft will

deduct any costs incurred in connection with closing or suspending your Store Account from any

App Proceeds otherwise payable to you and may retain any App Proceeds if appropriate under

the circumstances.



e. Taxes on Payments. You are responsible for your own taxes, including taxes

unique to where you reside, that are related to payments you may receive under this Agreement.

You are also responsible for paying any sales, use, goods and services, value-added, or similar

taxes (if any) in connection with the Store Fee that Microsoft collects from you. You must provide

accurate information regarding your tax profile as requested by Microsoft. If you complete and

submit to Microsoft a Certificate of Foreign Status, you (1) hereby represent and warrant that

your services are not provided in the U.S.; or (2) must notify Microsoft via e-mail to

us_services_notify@microsoft.com that your services are performed in the U.S. If Microsoft is

required to withhold any taxes on any amounts to be paid by Microsoft to you, Microsoft will

deduct such taxes from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority and,

as required, and solely to the extent within Microsoft's ability, as determined in its sole

discretion, obtain an official receipt for any such taxes withheld and deliver such receipt to you.

Microsoft will use reasonable efforts to minimize such taxes to the extent permissible under

applicable law, and each party will reasonably cooperate with the other to obtain the lowest tax

rates or elimination of such taxes pursuant to the applicable income tax treaties. If a Customer is

required to withhold any taxes on the purchase of your Apps or In -App Products, the amount

to be paid by Microsoft to you will be reduced by such withheld amount, and Microsoft will not

provide to you any receipt for any such withheld taxes. If you are located in Australia, wish to

submit paid Apps or In-App Products to the Store for distribution by Microsoft (or any sub-

agents appointed in accordance with Section 4(a) of this Agreement) as your agent or

commissionaire, you: (i) are required to be registered for Australian Goods Services Tax ("AU

GST"), (ii) must provide Microsoft with your Australian Business Number, and (iii) must affirm

that you are AU GST registered when setting up your Store Account. If you are located in New

Zealand and wish to submit paid Apps or In-App Products to the Store for distribution by

Microsoft (or any sub-agents appointed in accordance with Section 4(a) of this Agreement) as

your agent or commissionaire, you: (i) are required to be registered for New Zealand Goods and

Services Tax ("NZ GST") and (ii) must affirm that you are NZ GST registered when setting up your

Store Account. If you are in a country that recognizes a sale to Microsoft as a taxable supply for

VAT/GST purposes, that supply is deemed to be made to Microsoft exclusive of VAT. Microsoft

makes no warranty that its collection of taxes as related to agency transactions in the countries

listed in Exhibit A discharges developer from your own tax obligations.

20



f. Refund, Reconciliation and Offset. You are solely responsible for, and we

will deduct from any App Proceeds that we pay to you, all costs and expenses that we incur on

your behalf for returns and chargebacks of your App or In -App Products, including the full

refund and chargeback amounts that we paid or credited to Customers, unless Exhibit C applies

to the transaction. Refunds and/or chargebacks paid by Microsoft to the Customer after you

receive the App Proceeds will be debited against your account. Microsoft may offset any

amounts owed to Microsoft (including the refund and chargeback costs described in this

paragraph) against amounts Microsoft owes you. You grant Microsoft a right to provide refunds

to Customers in accordance with Microsoft's prevailing policies and applicable laws from time to

time.



g. Taxes on App Transactions for Apps That Use Microsoft’s Commerce

Engine. If your App uses the Microsoft commerce engine to support purchase of the App or any

In-App Purchases within the App, Microsoft (or its billing service provider or other authorized

partner) will collect and remit sales, use, goods and services, value added or similar taxes, if any,

applicable to Customers' acquisition of your App and In -App Product through the Store only in

the country(s) and to the extent described in the attached Exhibit A and Exhibit C, as may be

revised from time to time. Except as otherwise provided in Exhibit A and Exhibit C, Microsoft will

not remit any sales, use, goods and services, value added or other similar tax in connection with

Customers' acquisition of your App or In-App Products. You are responsible for reviewing

Exhibit A and Exhibit C in light of your circumstances and determining whether you have an

obligation to register, collect, and remit taxes in any country in which you elect to have

Microsoft make your App or In-App Product available to Customers and for complying with any

such tax obligations that apply to you.

h. Taxes on App Transactions for Apps That Do Not Use Microsoft’s

Commerce Engine. Microsoft will not be responsible for collecting or remitting any taxes in

connection with Customers’ acquisition of your App or In -App Product(s) in your App. It is your

responsibility to understand when applicable law requires you to issue Customers a tax invoice in

connection with their acquisition of your App or In-App Product(s) in your app and to issue that

invoice when required. Microsoft may grant Customers the ability to contact you in order to

obtain any required tax invoices.

i. Tax Remittance Exclusions. Further, for the sake of clarity, and

notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Exhibit A, or Exhibit C,

Microsoft will not be responsible for collecting and remitting telecommunications taxes or any

similar taxes in connection with Customers' acquisition of your App or In-App Product. You

acknowledge and agree to cooperate with Customers to facilitate the furnishing, exchange,

transmittal or other provision of tax documentation, and such cooperation includes, but is not

limited to, authorizing Microsoft to grant Customers the ability to contact you in order to obtain

any required tax invoices.



7. WARRANTIES. You represent, warrant and undertake to Microsoft that:



a. You have the power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to

fully perform your obligations under this Agreement;



b. If you are a business or other legal entity and not an individual, then the

21



individual entering into this Agreement on your behalf represents that he or she has all

necessary legal authority to bind you to this Agreement;



c. Your App, App Assets, and In-App Product, together with all advertising

or other materials or websites accessible from or that provide access to your App, App Assets,

and In-App Product complies with and will continue to comply with all requirements of this

Agreement, including the Certification Requirements, as well as all applicable laws, regulations,

and regulatory guidance;



d. Listing, distribution, and monetization of your App or In-App Product in

the Store does not and will not violate any agreements to which you are a party or of which

you are otherwise aware. You have obtained any and all consents, approvals or licenses

(including written consents of third parties where applicable) required for you to make your

App, App Assets, or In-App Product available in the Store and for your App to access any

Internet-based or Microsoft-provided services, if any, to which the App enables access;



e. Microsoft's exercise of the rights you grant under this Agreement will not

obligate Microsoft or its Affiliates to pay any third party any amounts; and



f. The information you provide to Microsoft under or in connection with this

Agreement is true, accurate, current, and complete.



8. CONFIDENTIALITY. If you have an existing NDA with Microsoft, then that

agreement applies to information exchanges. If not, then during the term of this Agreement and

for five (5) years after, the recipient of Confidential Information under this Agreement will hold in

confidence, and will not use or disclose any of the other party's Confidential Information to a

third party, except contractors who are performing on the receiving party's behalf and only

subject to confidentiality terms at least as protective as this section. "Confidential Information"

means all information that a party designates as confidential, or a reasonable person knows or

reasonably should understand to be confidential. Confidential Information does not include

information that is or becomes known to the receiving party without a breach of this agreement

or any other confidentiality obligation owed to a disclosing party. If you have any questions as to

what comprises Microsoft Confidential Information, you will consult with Microsoft. This section

does not prohibit either party from responding to lawful requests from law enforcement

authorities.



9. REPORTING; Data.



a. Reporting. Microsoft will provide you the reporting capabilities we are

required to provide under applicable tax laws and regulations. The reporting available to you

through Partner Center will provide aggregate information relating to your App downloads and

App and In-App Product transactions and Microsoft's payments to you under this Agreement.



b. Error Reporting Data. Microsoft may, at its discretion, provide you with app

crash data ("Error Reporting Data"). If Microsoft exposes you to any Personal Information in the

Error Reporting Data, then between you and Microsoft, that Personal Information is Microsoft

22



Confidential Information. You agree to use Error Reporting Data solely for the purpose of testing

and resolving compatibility issues, fixing and resolving "bugs" or other quality issues related to

your App, and not to disclose it for any purpose. You agree to inform Customers in your privacy

policy about Error Reporting Data that you collect and use. If the Error Reporting Data provided

to you includes any Personal Information, you agree to delete such Personal Information within

thirty (30) days after receipt, and to return to Microsoft or destroy that information immediately

upon Microsoft's request. During such thirty (30) days, you must store any Personal Information

only on a secure server with access to such server limited to you, or if an entity, your regular

employees. The following types of non-personally identifiable data can be retained beyond 30

days, also on a secure server with limited access: counts of error entities (e.g., buckets, events,

failures), version ranges, application names, module names, exception codes, problem classes,

failure offsets, extracted symbolic information including: call stacks and symbols, loaded and

unloaded module lists (including names, versions, and linker generated information, timestamps,

checksum, size). If you are served with a court order compelling disclosure of any Personal

Information, you will oppose the order, will notify Microsoft of such order, and will provide

Microsoft the opportunity to intervene before you file any response to the order. You agree to

conduct an audit on at least an annual basis to verify your compliance with the terms of this

section.



c. App Analytics Data. Microsoft may, at its discretion, provide you with in-

app telemetry ("App Analytics") data. If Microsoft exposes you to any Customer Personal

Information in the Error Reporting Data, then between you and Microsoft, that Personal

Information is Microsoft Confidential Information. You agree to use App Analytics data solely

for improving your App. Further, you agree not to provide any App Analytics data to third

parties (except for a third-party service provider who is assisting you in processing and

analyzing such data on your behalf and who is not permitted to use it for any other purpose or

disclose it to any other party). You are not permitted to aggregate (or permit any third- party

to aggregate) the App Analytics data with any third party data. You must not use th e App

Analytics data to attempt to identify or derive information about any particular end-user or

device.



10. DISCLAIMER, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND DEFENSE OF CLAIMS.

to intellectual property infringement, you grant to Microsoft a perpetual license to reproduce

and provide the App(s) or In-App Product(s) to Customers who previously downloaded the

App(s) or In-App Product(s) under the terms of the Customer's existing license, or for storage

management, backup and restore, or technical reasons.



c. Effect of Termination. Within 30 days of termination of this Agreement,

g. Out-of-Court Dispute Resolution. Should any appeal you submit to

Microsoft pursuant to the procedures described in Section 3(l) of this Agreement and related to

the provision of services by Microsoft to users located or having their place of establishment in

the European Union not be resolved, you are entitled to select any out-of-court dispute

settlement body within the European Union that has been certified by the Digital Services

Coordinator of the European Union Member State where the settlement body is established to

resolve such dispute. Such settlement body shall not have the power to impose a binding

settlement of the dispute upon the parties. Both parties agree to engage with such settlement

bodies in good faith, with a view to resolving the dispute, except that Microsoft may refuse to

engage with such settlement body if the dispute has already been resolved concerning the same

information and grounds. Additionally, from time to time, and where appropriate, Microsoft may

choose to resolve disputes with you through mediation. In the event that Microsoft determines,

in its sole discretion, that engaging in mediation would be the most effective means of resolving

any dispute with you, it will attempt to engage one of the following mediation service providers

(to the extent such providers are available and willing to provide their services) to mediate such

dispute:



i. Carlita Wallgren-Lindholm, Lindholm Wallgren

Store will not be deemed a waiver of any rights Microsoft may have under this Agreement,

including for violations of the Certification Requirements or other content related terms.

26



k. Survival. Sections of this Agreement that, by their terms, require

performance after the termination or expiration of this Agreement will survive.



l. Not Exclusive. This Agreement is nonexclusive, and nothing in this

Agreement restricts you or Microsoft from entering into other, similar agreements with other

marketplaces or app developers, or from acquiring, licensing, developing, manufacturing, or

distributing similar or competing technologies.

m. Updates. Microsoft may update this Agreement at any time in its sole

discretion. Microsoft will indicate the last date on which the Agreement was modified at the top

27



of the Agreement.



n. Entire Agreement. This is the entire Agreement between you and

Microsoft in connection with your Apps and In-App Products in the Store. It supersedes any

prior agreements between you and Microsoft regarding your Apps and In -App Products in the

Store. All parts of this Agreement apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law. If a

court holds that Microsoft can't enforce a part of this Agreement as written, Microsoft may

replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the

rest of this Agreement won't change. This Agreement's section titles are for reference only and

Last Updated: June 28, 2021



In the country(s) and to the extent listed at

agent, in making your App(s) and In-App Product(s) available in the Store.



If you choose to make any App(s) or In-App Product(s) available in the Store in any of

the listed country(s), you agree to the following modified and additional terms and conditions

solely in connection with the offering and distribution of your App(s) and In-App Product(s) in

such country(s) as described. Except as expressly provided in this Exhibit C, all of the terms and

conditions in the Agreement apply to the offering and distribution of your App(s) in such

country(s).



1. License Grants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4 of the

Agreement, for the country(s) referenced in this Exhibit C in which you choose to make your

App or In-App Product available, you grant to Microsoft a license (which you agree may be

sublicensed by Microsoft to its resale partners, in Microsoft's sole discretion, and by such resale

partners to other resale partners) to make the App or In -App Product available to Customers

and to provide the App and In-App Product through the Store. You do not transfer ownership

of any App to Microsoft by submitting it, but you do grant to Microsoft a license (which you

agree may be sublicensed by Microsoft to its resale partners, in Microsoft's sole discretion, and

by such resale partners to other resale partners), for the country(s) referenced in this Exhibit C

in which you choose to make your App available, (a) to host, install, use, reproduce, publicly

perform and display via any digital transmission technology, format, make available to

Customers (including through multiple tiers of distribution), insert third party ad controls

(selected by you via Partner Center), and sign your App(s) (including by removing preexisting

signatures) all for purposes of exercising Microsoft's rights and responsibilities under this

Agreement, including performing Certification of your App and conducting penetration or

other testing for identification of security vulnerabilities; and (b) directly or indirectly through

authorized partners (including pursuant to a sublicense agreement), to host, reproduce, market,

promote, offer, and provide your App(s) to Customers and to market, promote, offer, and make

available your In-App Product(s) to Customers. You will continue to license your App(s) and to

license and deliver your In-App Product(s) to Customers as provided in Section 4.i of the

Store, to verify that it continues to comply with this Agreement, remains compatible with

Microsoft's app development and distribution platforms, and to improve Microsoft's app

development and distribution platforms.



2. Marketing Rights. You grant Microsoft, its agents, contractors, licensees

(including Microsoft's authorized resale partners), marketing partners, and Affiliates the right to

use, reproduce, display, publicly perform and publish your entity name, App or portion of your

and accessories, Xbox Live Services, Xbox.com and other Windows, Windows Phone and/or

Xbox-related websites and each of their successor platforms, and/or any other Microsoft

websites, products and services related to the Store and/or Apps. Nothing in this Agreement,

however, will preclude Microsoft from using your App, App Assets, and/or In-App Product as

permitted by law without a license (e.g., "fair use" under applicable copyright law or "referential"

use under trademark law).



3. Application Pricing; Taxes on Applications. Notwithstanding Section 6 of the

Agreement, when you submit an App and choose to make the App or an In -App Product

available as provided in this Exhibit C, you may suggest the price (if any) to be charged to

Customers (consistent with the price points specified by Microsoft in the Documentation) in that

country, and Microsoft may charge that price (or another price that Microsoft or a resale partner

chooses in its discretion) in making your App or In -App Product available in the Store in that

country. For any App or In-App Product you choose to make available as provided in this Exhibit

C, Microsoft (or a resale partner or billing service provider) will collect and remit sales, use,

goods and services, value added or similar taxes, if any, applicable to the Customer's acquisition

of your App or In-App Product in such country(s) through the Store as provided in this Exhibit C.

Except as provided herein, Microsoft will not remit any sales, use, goods and services, value

added or other similar tax in connection with Customers' acquisition of your App(s) or In-App

Product(s).



4. Payment Terms and Fees. App Proceeds payable to you in connection with the

sale of your App or In-App Product in the country(s) listed in this Exhibit C will be calculated and

paid to you as provided in Section 6 but the App Proceeds will be provided to you as a royalty

payment in exchange for the license granted in paragraph 1 of this Exhibit C. You agree that: (i)

you are responsible for all costs and expenses that we incur for returns and chargebacks arising

out of the purchase by a Customer of any App or In -App Products, including the full refund and

chargeback amounts that we paid or credited to Customers; and (ii) we can deduct from any

royalty payment we make to you any of the foregoing costs and expenses.

as identified and agreed to in a Preload Addendum.

with the applicable Microsoft Products identified in the Preload Addendum prior to delivery of

such App(s) to Microsoft.



c. Testing, Acceptance, or Rejection. Microsoft may test your App(s) beyond

the testing conducted during Certification to ensure a good App experience for Customers on

Microsoft Products. In the event Microsoft detects Errors, Microsoft will inform you of the same,

and Microsoft may reject your App(s) as being unsuitable for Preload. In the event Microsoft

rejects the App, you agree to correct such Errors within thirty (30) days of being notified of

rejection.



d. Errors and Updates. You agree to correct any material Errors detected (by

either party) in your App(s) after being Preloaded by promptly publishing Updates in the Store.

You will ensure that any Updates are compatible with the Microsoft Products selected for

Preload.



e. FOSS Claims. If either party receives (and determines in good faith the

validity of) any third-party claim that your App(s) violate any FOSS license terms, then you agree

to promptly remedy the basis for the claim (e.g., provide missing notices or attributions, deliver

underlying source code, etc.) and/or Update the App to remove the FOSS that is the basis for

the claim.



4. Effect of Termination. Termination or expiration of a Preload Addendum will not

affect any rights of a Customer to use your App(s). Within six (6) months (or earlier, if possible)

of termination or expiration of a Preload Addendum, Microsoft will discontinue Preloading your

App(s) and using your App Assets in connection therewith depending on what stage the

affected Microsoft Products are in the manufacturing process. Termination or expiration of a

re



If you choose to make any App(s) or In-App Product(s) available in the Store that is

packaged as a Win32 App, you agree to the following amendments and additions to the

Agreement solely in connection with the offering and distribution of such App(s) and In-App

Product(s). Except as expressly provided in this Exhibit E, all of the terms and conditions in the

Agreement apply to the offering and distribution of such Apps in such country(s).



1. Definitions.



a. Section 1(c) of the Agreement is amended and restated to read as follows:

"Application" or "App" means an application or extension that can be submitted to

Partner Center, including, but not limited to, any App and/or installer of such App

hosted by You on a separate hosting service, such as a content delivery network

(CDN), that Microsoft accesses to enable download and install of your App in the

Store.



b. Section 1(f) of the Agreement is amended and restated to read as follows:

“Certification" means Microsoft's process for testing the compliance of Apps

with the applicable Certification Requirements. App is "Certified" when

third-party that is acceptable to Microsoft, in its sole discretion.



2. Submission. 3(a) of the Agreement is amended and restated to read as follows: You must

submit to Microsoft each App and associated App metadata that you wish to make available

through the Store. Submission of each App will include providing (1) a link to an installer for

App that is hosted on a separate hosting service. You are solely responsible and liable for the

App and In-App Products you submit. You are responsible for supporting your App and for

delivering and supporting your In-App Products. Microsoft will retain (or destroy) all copies

of the App and other materials you submit. Microsoft will not return them, so you must

maintain your own backup copies.



3. Updates to Apps. Section 3(b) of the Agreement is amended and restated to read as follows:

able to receive updates from the Store. Apps can be updated directly by You via your App

Policies currently available here http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=512933, which

and distribution through the Store. The updated App is subject to all of the requirements of

this Agreement, including the Microsoft Store Policies currently available here

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=512933. You may not add any new functionality

to your App via an update which requires written consent from the Customer without first

providing notice to the Customer and obtaining any consents as may be required by law in

the markets where you choose to distribute your App. The Store will retain copies of your

most recent app packages to distribute in case the app installer hosted by you on a separate

hosting service, such as a content delivery network (CDN), is swapped with new app installer

packages without submission through the Partner Center or API. The Store will also

download the new app packages and initiate the process of certification. If the updates pass

certification tests, the Store makes them available for end users. If the updates fail

certification tests, the Store will revert to distributing the previously retained app installer

copy and notify you to submit the updates through Partner Center or API.



4. Appointment as Agent. Section 4.a.i is amended and restated to read as follows: Microsoft's

role is to provide the technology and services to enable the Store, and to facilitate the

purchase by Customers of Apps and In-App Products in such Apps through the Store. Except

as otherwise provided in Exhibit C to this Agreement, you appoint Microsoft to act as your

agent or commissionaire, as applicable, for these purposes and you acknowledge that you,

not Microsoft, are the distributor of each App and/or In-App Product that is acquired

through the Store. You give Microsoft the right to appoint any Microsoft Affiliates as sub-

agents and also grant any Microsoft Affiliates appointed by Microsoft as sub-agents the

right to appoint other Microsoft Affiliates as sub-agents.

When you submit an App, you must disclose to Microsoft (1) whether you will require

customers to pay to access functionalities available in the App and (2) whether you will make

available paid In-App Product(s) in the App. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,

Microsoft will not remit any sales, use, goods and services, value added or other similar tax

in connection with Customers' acquisition of your App(s) or In-App Product(s) in such Apps,

and you shall be solely responsible for all App and App In-App Product(s) pricing practices,

which shall, at a minimum, comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and regulatory

guidance.
