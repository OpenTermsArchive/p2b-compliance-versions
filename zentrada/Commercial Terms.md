On the basis of the non-binding request for quotation in his order management of zentrada, the supplier shall check the availability of the articles in the desired quantity, determine the exact shipping costs and estimated delivery time to the delivery address specified by zentrada. The sales tax treatment in purchasing from the supplier shall be suggested by zentrada in the request for quotation and in the delivery order and shall form the basis of the settlement.

Should restrictions of use or distribution exist for the country of destination or on the basis of the information provided by zentrada, these shall be expressly indicated in the binding invitatio ad offerendum. Approvals, certifications and registration requirements that deviate from EU law and are country-specific, e.g. for disposal, shall not be the responsibility of the supplier.

In the event of a later cancellation for reasons for which the supplier is responsible, a cancellation fee shall be charged to the supplier. Further claims on the part of zentrada shall remain unaffected.

For this purpose, he shall receive a qualified credit note from zentrada for settlement and payment by zentrada.  
    

‍

### **§ 9 Delivery time and delay in delivery**

1.  The delivery time stated in zentrada's offer on the basis of the supplier's invitation to submit an offer shall generally be the binding target date, unless expressly agreed otherwise.
2.  Should the supplier fail to perform or fail to perform within the agreed delivery time or should the supplier be in default with the delivery of the goods to the destination specified by zentrada, the rights of zentrada - in particular with respect to withdrawal and compensation for damages - shall be determined in accordance with the statutory provisions. The provisions in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall remain unaffected by this.
3.  If the preconditions for default are met, zentrada shall be entitled to dissolve the contract with the supplier if zentrada no longer has an interest in the performance of the contract with the supplier due to the delay. 
4.  In the event that the prerequisites for default exist, the supplier shall be obligated to indemnify zentrada from the claims of third parties, in particular potential purchasers of the goods, due to the supplier not delivering the goods or not delivering the goods on time.

  

### **§ 10 Performance, delivery, transfer of risk, default of acceptance**

1.  The supplier shall bear the procurement risk for the services owed by him, unless otherwise agreed from the outset in individual cases (e.g. limitation to stock).
2.  The delivery shall be made in accordance with INCOTERM 2020 DAP to the place specified by zentrada in the delivery order vis-à-vis the supplier (place of destination). The respective place of destination shall also be the place of performance for the delivery (obligation to deliver). The supplier may agree upon self-collection of the goods with zentrada_._ 
3.  The supplier shall take over the invoice or delivery note from zentrada to the customer of zentrada and attach it to the delivery.
4.  The risk of accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the goods shall only pass to zentrada upon handover at the place of performance.

  

### **§ 11 Prices and terms of payment**

1.  The price stated in the invitation to tender for delivery and in zentrada's delivery order shall be binding. All price quotations vis-à-vis the procurement platform shall be net or plus the respective applicable statutory value-added tax.
2.  Settlement and payment to the supplier shall be made by zentrada via credit notes and chargebacks for the individual orders and deliveries. These shall be debited with the agreed purchase discounts, cost allowances and bonuses and shall be balanced weekly after delivery confirmation by zentrada within 10 working days after shipment, or after clarification of all reported delivery deficiencies, and shall be paid out to the bank details deposited by the supplier in the zentrada system within 1-3 days. zentrada shall not be liable for possibly incorrect or outdated information on bank details. The supplier shall be obliged to check the settlement within 30 days. Possible subsequent claims of the supplier due to billing errors shall expire upon expiry of the checking period.
3.  The supplier and zentrada shall each have a right of set-off or retention due to established or undisputed counterclaims.

  

### **§ 12 Defective delivery**

1.  The statutory provisions shall apply to the rights of zentrada in the event of material defects and defects of title of the goods and in the event of other breaches of duty by the supplier, unless otherwise stipulated below.
2.  The supplier shall be liable to zentrada for ensuring that the goods have the agreed quality upon transfer of risk. In particular, those product descriptions which - in particular based on the information provided by the supplier by designation or reference in zentrada's binding delivery order - are the subject matter of the contract or were included in the contract in the same way as these GPC shall be deemed to be an agreement on the quality. It makes no difference whether the product description originates from the supplier, the manufacturer or another person.
3.  The supplier warrants that the goods sold do not violate any rights of third parties within the EU, are not subject to any restrictions regarding their distribution and comply with the currently applicable regulations of Union law. In the event that claims are asserted against zentrada by third parties, in particular its customers, due to an alleged infringement of rights, the supplier shall indemnify zentrada against such claims, notwithstanding the provisions of § 7 para. 6 of these GPC. Section 7 (6) of these GPC shall apply accordingly in this case.
4.  With regard to the goods sold, the supplier shall not be responsible for compliance with country-specific norms, guidelines and standards applicable in the country of destination named by zentrada.
5.  zentrada shall not be obligated to inspect the goods or make special enquiries about any defects upon conclusion of the contract. Notwithstanding § 442 para. 1 sentence 2 BGB, zentrada shall also be entitled to unrestricted defect rights if the defect remained unknown to zentrada upon conclusion of the contract due to gross negligence.
6.  The statutory provisions (Sections 377, 381 of the German Commercial Code \[HGB\]) shall apply to the commercial obligation to inspect and give notice of defects, subject to the following proviso: zentrada's obligation to inspect shall be limited to such defects which become apparent during the incoming goods inspection by means of external inspection including the delivery documents (e.g. externally recognisable transport damage, wrong delivery and short delivery) or which are recognisable during the quality inspection by means of random sampling. Apart from that, it depends on the extent to which an inspection is feasible in the ordinary course of business, taking into account the circumstances of the individual case. The obligation of zentrada to give notice of defects discovered later shall remain unaffected. Notwithstanding zentrada's aforementioned obligation to investigate, a complaint (notice of defect) shall be deemed to have been made without delay and in a timely manner if it is communicated within five working days of discovery or, in the case of obvious defects, within two working days of delivery, but no later than within ten days of a problem report on the procurement platform.
7.  Furthermore, zentrada shall be entitled to reduce the purchase price or withdraw from the contract in the event of a material defect or defect of title in accordance with the statutory provisions, and zentrada shall be entitled to assert claims for damages as well as claims for reimbursement of expenses against the supplier in accordance with the statutory provisions.

  

### **§ 13 Supplier recourse**

1.  In addition to the aforementioned defect rights, zentrada shall be entitled to the legally determined recourse claims within a supply chain (supplier recourse pursuant to §§ 445a, 445b, 478 BGB) against the supplier without restriction. zentrada shall in particular be entitled to demand from the supplier exactly the type of subsequent performance (rectification or replacement delivery) that zentrada owes its respective customer in the individual case. The legal right of choice of zentrada (§ 439 para. 1 BGB) shall not be restricted by this.
2.  Before zentrada acknowledges or fulfils a defect right asserted by one of its customers (including reimbursement of expenses pursuant to §§ 445a para. 1, 439 para. 2 and 3 BGB), zentrada shall notify the supplier via the procurement platform and request a corresponding statement, briefly explaining the facts of the matter. If a substantiated statement is not made within a reasonable period of time and if no amicable solution is brought about, the right to claim for defects actually granted by zentrada shall be deemed to be owed to zentrada's customer. In this case, the supplier shall have the burden of proof to the contrary.
3.  The claims of zentrada arising from supplier recourse shall also apply if the defective goods have been further processed by a third party.

  

### **§ 14 Producer liability**

1.  If the supplier is responsible for product damage, the supplier shall indemnify zentrada from third-party claims to the extent that the cause lies within the supplier's sphere of control and organisation and the supplier itself is liable vis-à-vis third parties.
2.  Within the scope of his indemnification obligation, the supplier shall reimburse zentrada for expenses pursuant to §§ 683, 670 BGB (German Civil Code) that arise from or in connection with a third party claim including recall actions carried out by zentrada. zentrada shall inform the supplier about the content and scope of recall measures - to the extent possible and reasonable - and give him the opportunity to comment. Further legal claims shall remain unaffected.

  

### **§ 15 Limitation**

1.  The mutual claims of the contracting parties shall become statute-barred in accordance with the statutory provisions, unless otherwise stipulated below.
2.  Notwithstanding § 438 para. 1 no. 3 BGB, the general limitation period for claims for defects shall be 3 years from the transfer of risk. Insofar as acceptance has been agreed, the limitation period shall begin with acceptance. The 3-year limitation period shall also apply accordingly to claims arising from defects of title, whereby the statutory limitation period for claims for surrender in rem of third parties (§ 438 para. 1 no. 1 BGB) shall remain unaffected; claims arising from defects of title shall furthermore not become time-barred in any case as long as the third party can still assert the right against zentrada - in particular in the absence of a limitation period.
3.  The limitation periods of the law on sales including the above extension shall apply - to the legal extent - to all contractual claims for defects. Insofar as Zentrada is also entitled to non-contractual claims for damages due to a defect, the regular statutory limitation period shall apply (§§ 195, 199 BGB), unless the application of the limitation periods of the law of sales leads to a longer limitation period in individual cases.

  

### **Section 4 Final provisions  
§ 16 Choice of law and place of jurisdiction**

1.  These GPC and the contractual relationship between zentrada and the supplier shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding international uniform law, in particular the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
2.  The exclusive - also international - place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from the contractual relationship shall be zentrada's place of business in Würzburg. However, zentrada shall also be entitled in all cases to file suit at the place of performance of the delivery obligation pursuant to these GPC or a prior individual agreement or at the supplier's general place of jurisdiction. Overriding statutory provisions, in particular regarding exclusive jurisdiction, shall remain unaffected.
3.  (Any amendment or cancellation of individual provisions of these GPC shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The same applies if one of the above provisions should prove to be invalid.
