5\. About the Shop​

What is the Shop?​

The Shop is an e-commerce platform, which mainly allows Sellers to Offer Products to Users of the Shop. The Products may also be advertised, promoted, and displayed on the TikTok Platform to its Users, but any transactions in relation to the Products will only be processed and facilitated via the Shop.

How to Sell Products​

You may sell Your Products in the manners made available to You (e.g., add the anchor link of the Products to the content shared by You or on Your behalf, or sell Your Products via live streaming). The availability of some functionalities used for selling Products may be restricted to certain Sellers, as determined at Tokopedia’s sole discretion. ​

You agree to immediately remove any Product from the Shop if it is subject to any recall or safety notice. It is a material breach of these Terms if You do not remove any such Product.​

Product Ranking​

The main parameters We use when determining whether and how Your Products are offered to Users are: ​

• User information: information Users disclose in their account. For example, their age, gender, location, or interests they have disclosed to Us via their User settings;​

• Product listing quality: We measure Product listing quality by assessing relevant features of the Product listing, such as whether the images of the Products are of a low quality; and​

​

How do the Payment Services Work?​

1\. Receiving payments for purchases on the Shop​

Notwithstanding the remaining Terms (including without limitation Clause 5 (What is the Shop) and Clause 11 (Fees)), and any other terms as set out in the documents referred in these Terms, You acknowledge that We are not Your collection agent, and We do not provide any payment services to you, including without limitation processing any payments or refunds to or for You, accepting or processing payment from or to Buyers, transferring payments to or from You or on behalf of you, or providing any merchant acquiring, money transfer or other payment processing services (“Payment Services”) to You, the Buyers, the Creators or any other parties, under any circumstances. The Payment Services will be provided to You by our affiliate, PIPO (HK) Limited (“PIPO HK”) in its own capacity, or through its appropriately licensed affiliates or partners engaged by it.​

As a condition to using the Shop, You will be subject to a seller payment service agreement (“Seller Payment Service Agreement”) with PIPO HK, which will stipulate the terms and conditions of the Payment Services that PIPO HK may agree to provide to You (the Seller Payment Service Agreement applicable to Payment Services provided by PIPO HK is [Seller Payment Service Agreement](https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/article/agreement?knowledge_id=10011390&identity=1)). By agreeing to these Terms, You agree to be bound by the Seller Payment Service Agreement with PIPO HK. If You do not enter into the Seller Payment Service Agreement with PIPO HK, We will not be able to provide the Shop to You, because PIPO HK will not be in a position to provide any Payment Services to You, which means that You will not receive payments for Your Products sold on the Shop.​

For the avoidance of doubt, You acknowledge and agree that while We may provide instructions on Your behalf to PIPO HK to facilitate or support the Payment Services that PIPO HK provides to You, any Payment Services that PIPO HK provides to You will be provided by PIPO HK in its own capacity (including through its appropriately licensed affiliates or partners), and We are not acting as an agent or delegate of PIPO HK with respect to such Payment Services. We will not be liable to You for any losses suffered as a result of any breach or default by PIPO HK under the Seller Payment Service Agreement, or any other agreement that You enter into with PIPO HK with respect to the Payment Services or otherwise.​

​

2\. Payment instructions​

You acknowledge that as the Shop provider, We will have information on transactions (including orders, conclusion of sales, payments and refunds to be made between Buyer and You).

In this regard, You appoint us, the Shop provider, as Your attorney, and acknowledge and agree for, and authorise, Us to provide information and instructions to PIPO HK on Your behalf, so that PIPO HK (including through its other appropriately licensed affiliates or partners) may carry out the Payment Services for You. Without limitation, You authorise Us to notify PIPO HK of the following events:​

• whether there are any refund requests, return requests or disputes raised by the Buyer within 14 days from the date the order status on Shop is changed to “delivered”, the conclusion of any settlement agreement between Buyer and You as a result of refund requests, return requests or disputes raised, and how monies will be processed in accordance with such settlement agreement;​

• any order, ruling, award or judgement from a competent court, arbitration tribunal or authority which directs the release of monies;​

​

3\. Deduction of payments for Creators and Us​

You acknowledge that a portion of the payments from the Buyers will be deducted and paid to the Creators, as fees payable by You to the Creators (“Creator Commissions”) as agreed by You and the applicable Creator. PIPO HK will provide Payment Services to the Creators to enable Creators to view the amounts of Creator Commissions (after deduction of relevant fees/charges, if any) held by PIPO HK on behalf of the Creators and to initiate withdrawal and transfer of the Creator Commissions from PIPO HK to the Creators (and such other parties as authorized by the Creators, if any), in accordance with the terms of the Creator Payment Service Agreement between PIPO HK and the Creator. (The Creator Payment Service Agreement applicable to Payment Services provided by PIPO HK is: [Creator Payment Service Agreement](https://oneunita.com/agreement/template?code=TTS_ID_Creator_PSA_PIPOHK)).​

You further acknowledge that a portion of the payments from the Buyers will be deducted and paid to Us as Fees for the use of the Shop or any other fees due to Us . ​

You acknowledge and agree that as the Affiliate Feature and the Shop provider, We may, as Your attorney or the Creator's attorney, as the case may be, provide all information relating to the arrangements between You and the Creators, the transactions between You and the Buyer and any authorities granted to us, to enable PIPO HK to provide the Payment Services to the Creator, including without limitation:​

• amounts to be deducted from payments from the Buyer which are due to Us or any other affiliates or parties, including any platform fees and logistics service fees that are due to Us, and any Creator Commissions that are due to the Creators pursuant to the arrangement between You and the Creator via Affiliate Feature;​

• whether there are any refund requests, return requests or disputes raised by the Buyer within 14 days from the date the order status on Shop is changed to “delivered”, the conclusion of any settlement agreement between Buyer and You as a result of refund requests, return requests or disputes raised, and how monies will be processed in accordance with such settlement agreement;​

For the avoidance of doubt, You acknowledge and agree that while We may provide instructions on the Creator's behalf to PIPO HK to facilitate or support the Payment Services that PIPO HK provides to the Creator, any Payment Services that PIPO HK provides to the Creator will be provided by PIPO HK in its own capacity (including through its appropriately licensed affiliates or partners), and We are not acting as an agent or delegate of PIPO HK with respect to such Payment Services.​

You further grant us a royalty-free license to use your user name, trademark, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as the source of any of your Seller Materials.​

Whenever you access or use a feature that allows you to upload or transmit Seller Materials through the Shop (including via certain third party social media platforms), or to make contact with other users of the Shop, you must comply with the standards set out under these Terms. You may also choose to upload or transmit your Seller Materials on sites or platforms hosted by third parties. If you decide to do this, you must comply with their content guidelines as well as with the standards set out under these Terms.​

You warrant that any such contribution does comply with those standards, and you will be liable to us and indemnify us for any breach of that warranty. This means you will be responsible for any loss or damage we suffer as a result of your breach of warranty.​

Any Seller Materials will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. You must not post any Seller Materials on or through the Shop or transmit to us any Seller Materials that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.

If you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recordings, then you must not post such sound recordings to the Shop unless you have all permissions, clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Shop​

For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in the preceding paragraphs include, but are not limited to, the right to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in such sound recordings), and publicly perform and communicate to the public sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), all on a royalty-free basis.

Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists. If you are a composer or author of a musical work and are affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license you grant through these Terms in your Seller Materials to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in these Terms in your Seller Materials or have such music publisher enter into these Terms with us. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant us the licenses in these Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Shop is in compliance with any contractual obligations you may have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the Shop that may be claimed by your label.​

Tokopedia, as a marketplace service provider, may use commercially reasonable efforts to require Partners to provide accurate and updated information, but Tokopedia does not guarantee or endorse the quality of any Partner Services, information or services provided by Partners.​

​

How to use the Marketplace and authorise a Partner Service?​

Your inability to continue to use the Partner Services as a result is attributable to the fault or negligence of the Partner and you shall not have recourse to Us and any liabilities or damages shall be independently assumed by the Partner.​

• Tokopedia does not control the Partner Services or the content relevant to the Partner Services provided by Partners, and shall not be liable for safety, reliability and usability of such Partner Services or content, nor shall Tokopedia be liable for censorship of Partner Services or endorse any content, description, advertisement or other materials with regard to the Partner Services.
