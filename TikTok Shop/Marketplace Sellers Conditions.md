5.       **About the TikTok Shop**

**What is the TikTok Shop?**

The TikTok Shop is a social e-commerce platform, which mainly allows Merchants to Offer Products to Users of the Platform. A User who buys a Product from a Merchant is a Buyer in these Terms. 

The TikTok Shop allows Merchants to:

•         get access to seller center (“**Seller Center**”) and utilize the services/features We offer;

•         upload and manage Product information and listings for display to Users;

•         receive orders and conclude sales to Buyers;

•         track and manage orders and deliveries;

•         provide customer services to Buyers; 

•         establish promotion plans, e.g. through the affiliate feature; and

•         use other functionalities and features (e.g. Showcase) offered by TikTok Shop to Merchant.

TikTok is not liable for the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, negligence, or breaches of any Creator or any property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting therefrom and takes no responsibility whatsoever regarding the Creator Services rendered by Creators generally or to You specifically.
