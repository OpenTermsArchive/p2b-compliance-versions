​

5. About the TikTok Shop​

​

What is the TikTok Shop?​

​

The TikTok Shop is a social e-commerce platform, which mainly allows Sellers to Offer Products to Users of the Platform. A User who buys a Product from a Seller is a Buyer in these Terms. ​

​

The TikTok Shop allows Sellers to:​

​

• get access to seller center (“Seller Center”) and utilize the services/features We offer;​

​

• upload and manage Product information and listings for display to Users;​

​

• receive orders and conclude sales to Buyers;​

​

• track and manage orders and deliveries;​

​

• provide customer services to Buyers; ​

​

• establish promotion plans, e.g., through the affiliate feature; and​

​

• use other functionalities and features (e.g., Showcase) offered by TikTok Shop to Seller.​

​

Further information about the features of the TikTok Shop can be found in the TikTok Shop Academy ([Singapore](https://seller-sg.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center), [Indonesia](https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1), [Malaysia](https://seller-my.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1), [the Philippines](https://seller-ph.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center), [Thailand](https://seller-th.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1), [UK](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=2), [Vietnam](https://seller-vn.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1)).​

​

​

​

​

​

IMPORTANT: The contract for sale of the Product (the “Sale”) is always between the Seller and the Buyer. You are responsible for compliance with all laws applicable to that Offer and Sale, both in the Buyer’s location and Your location (collectively, “Applicable Law”). You must also comply with the contract between you and the Buyer for the sale of Products (the “Terms of Sale”) – see here. It is a material breach of these Terms if You do not comply with Applicable Law or the [Terms of Sale](https://sf19-draftcdn-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/ies-hotsoon-draft-sg/magellan_ecommerce/ttec_tos_en.html).​

​

Who Can Use the TikTok Shop?​

​

Sellers approved in advance by TikTok can use the TikTok Shop. If You are approved, You can also authorise a third party to manage and to engage with the TikTok Shop on Your behalf. ​

​

IMPORTANT: If You do authorise a third party to do this for You, You will remain responsible for all their activities on the TikTok Shop.​

​

Where Can You Use the TikTok Shop to Sell Products?​

​

Approved Sellers can use the TikTok Shop to Offer Products to Users located in any of the jurisdictions where the TikTok Shop is made available by TikTok from time to time. ​

​

Does TikTok Sell Products Itself on the TikTok Shop?​

​

No.​

​

​

​

6. How to Use the TikTok Shop​

​

How to register as a Seller on TikTok Shop​

​

Before registering as a Seller on the TikTok Shop, You will need to have a Platform account (“Account”). You will be asked to provide certain information (“Onboarding Information”) to TikTok during the registration process. We will use Your Onboarding Information to assess whether or not You will be authorised to use the TikTok Shop. If You are, You will be able to access Seller functionality via the TikTok Shop. Instructions for registering as a Seller and what Onboarding Information You will need to provide can be found in the TikTok Shop Seller Registration Guidelines ([Singapore](https://seller-sg.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10012299), [Indonesia](https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10000749&identity=1), [Malaysia](https://seller-my.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10008401), [the Philippines](https://seller-ph.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10009149), [Thailand](https://seller-th.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10008415), [UK](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10001420), [Vietnam](https://seller-vn.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10008391)). It is a material breach of these Terms if You do not provide, and maintain at all times, complete and accurate Onboarding Information.​

​

As part of the registration process, if you are a Seller based in China (including Hong Kong), You will also be required to provide a deposit to Us. We (or one of Our affiliates) will retain the deposit while You are a Seller on the TikTok Shop. When reasonably required, We may use the deposit to protect TikTok, Buyers and Users in the event that You do not comply with these Terms, applicable laws, regulations or guidance, and/or any other applicable policies, rules or requirements, including but not limited to compensating TikTok where it has made payment to a Buyer as a result of Your conduct or Products. The amount of deposit payable may depend on the types of products that You intend to offer on the TikTok Shop. If a deduction is made from Your deposit, You will be required to submit further funds to cover the deduction and ensure that the full deposit amount is held by Us. The remaining balance of Your deposit will be returned to You when You are no longer a Seller on the TikTok Shop. You will be fully responsible for any costs, fees or other expenses (including but not limited to losses due to currency conversion) incurred during the process of transferring Your deposit to Us and when We return the remaining balance of Your deposit to You. For full details of the deposit rules, please review the [TikTok Shop Cross-Border Shop Deposit Policy](https://seller.tiktokglobalshop.com/university/essay?knowledge_id=10011795&role=1&identity=1).​

​

IMPORTANT: After You are authorised to use Your Account for the TikTok Shop, Your Account will automatically switch from a non-business Account to a business Account.​

​

If there is an inconsistency between these Terms and the Platform Terms of Service ([EEA, UK and Switzerland](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/eea/terms-of-service/en), [Other regions](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/row/terms-of-service/en)), these Terms shall prevail to the extent of any inconsistency, to the extent such conflict relates to the TikTok Shop.​

​

How to List Products​

​

Once You have successfully registered as a Seller on the TikTok Shop, You will be able to upload the details of Your Product(s) and list them for display to Users. Instructions for how to do this and the checks We conduct before a listing goes live (“Product Eligibility Criteria”) can be found in the TikTok Shop Academy ([Singapore](https://seller-sg.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center), [Indonesia](https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1), [Malaysia](https://seller-my.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1), [the Philippines](https://seller-ph.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center), [Thailand](https://seller-th.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1), [UK](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=2), [Vietnam](https://seller-vn.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1)) and the TikTok Shop Product Listing Guidelines for Sellers ([Singapore](https://seller-sg.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10009152), [Indonesia](https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10000849), [Malaysia](https://seller-my.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10008559), [the Philippines](https://seller-ph.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10009152), [Thailand](https://seller-th.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10008548), [UK](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10001422), [Vietnam](https://seller-vn.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10008395)). It is a material breach of these Terms if You do not provide complete and accurate details of Your Products to Buyers prior to and after a Sale. ​

​

Your Product listing must make available all legally required terms and conditions (under Applicable Law) to a Buyer prior to the conclusion of any Sale. It is a material breach of these Terms if You do not provide a Buyer such terms and conditions prior to the conclusion of any Sale.​

​

How to Sell Products​

​

You may sell Your Products in the manners made available to You (e.g., add the anchor link of the Products to the content shared by You or on Your behalf, or sell Your Products via live streaming). The availability of some functionalities used for selling Products may be restricted to certain Sellers, as determined at TikTok’s sole discretion. ​

What is Affiliate Feature?​

​

Affiliate Feature is a feature of the TikTok Shop to allow Sellers to set either public or targeted promotion plans and connect with TikTok creators (“Creator(s)”) for the promotion of a Seller’s Products on the Platform (collectively, the “Creator Services”).​

​

​

​

You understand that Affiliate Feature is provided solely to allow You to connect with Creators and create public or targeted promotion plans for Your Products via the functionality We make available to You. For example, choosing Products and setting commission rates for the relevant Creator Services provided by a Creator. ​

​

​

​

Your use of Affiliate Feature for any other purpose is prohibited, and may result in termination of Your access to the Affiliate Feature, TikTok Shop and/or the Platform.​

​

​

​

​

​

​

Engagement is between You and Creator​

​

​

• TikTok has no liability for any claims in relation to the any contract between You and the Creator, including but not limited to claims related to Your Products, any call to action and/or other promotional messages, information or content that You require the Creator to include in the Creator Content (as defined below), or the Creator Services performed by the Creator.​

​

​

​

Creators carry on a profession or business on their own account and if You engage Creators You acknowledge You do so as a customer or client of the Creator and not of TikTok. You understand that Creators are not employees, workers, agents or contractors of TikTok.​

​

​

​

TikTok is not liable for the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, negligence, or breaches of any Creator or any property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting therefrom and takes no responsibility whatsoever regarding the Creator Services rendered by Creators generally or to You specifically. ​

​

​

​

​

In order to use the Affiliate Feature, the following provisions in this subsection (Licenses in Connection with Creator Content) are deemed to be included in your contracts or agreements with Creators, which TikTok is not a party to and shall not be responsible for, regarding grants of rights in and to: (a) the Seller Materials for Creator’s provision of the Creator Services to You; and (b) the Creator Content for Your exploitation thereof: ​

​

• License of Seller Materials. You grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-licensable, irrevocable license in and to Your Seller Materials to Creators (i) for purposes of Creators’ provision of the Creator’s Services to You, to reproduce, display, stream (including live streaming), distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform, make available, publish, translate and make derivative works in any form or medium, make, use, transfer, import, and exercise any and all such rights in and to Your Seller Materials during the term of the Creator’s provision of the Creator Services to You; and (ii) following the expiry of the aforesaid term, to continue to distribute, publish, copy, reproduce, public perform or otherwise make available the Creator Content created during the term. ​

9. Service Market and Partner Services​

​

​

​

• What are Service Market and Services? ​

​

• Service Market: means the platform that is part of the Seller Center where You may browse the Public Services provided by Partners,. ​

​

• “Partner” herein refers to the third-party service provider, including multi-channel network, independent service provider, affiliate partner or talent scout who has been registered in TikTok Shop Partner Center (“TTSPC”) and offers Partner Services to Sellers. ​

​

• Public Service: means the service provided by Partners to You on TTSPC, which is disclosed on the Service Market and is authorised by You. ​

​

• Custom Service: means the service provided by Partners to You, which is not disclosed on Service Market, and is authorised by You. ​

​

• Partner Service(s): means Public Service and Custom Service which are contracted by You directly with the applicable Partner. For avoidance of doubt, the Partner Services do not form part of TikTok Shop offering and are provided by Partners and contracted by you directly with the Partner and not through the TTSPC.​

​

​

​

Service Market as Marketplace​

​

IMPORTANT: TikTok does not itself sell Partner Services. TikTok allows Partners to promote Partner Services on the Service Market. TikTok may facilitate the promotion and sale of Partner Services on the Service Market by Partners to you. The service contract for Partner Services is always solely between You and the Partner. TikTok is not (a) the buyer or the seller of Partner Services; (b) responsible for the fulfilment of the service contract or any contract between You and the Partner; or (c) an agent of You or the Partner in connection with any provision or purchase of Partner Services. The Partner of the Partner Service will be shown on the service description page (“Description Page”) and Your rights of recourse, for example in relation to refunds and cancellations, will be between You and the Partner. TikTok, as a marketplace service provider, may use commercially reasonable efforts to require Partners to provide accurate and updated information, but TikTok does not guarantee or endorse the quality of any Partner Services, information or services provided by Partners.​

​

​

​

How to use the Marketplace and authorise a Partner Service?​

​

You can use your Account to authorise a Partner Service provided by a Partner.

​

​

​

(a) Agreement to Binding Individual Arbitration Between You and TikTok​

​

You and TikTok, including third-party beneficiaries, agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the TTS U.S. Cross-Border Seller Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof will be resolved by binding arbitration, and not in a court of law. Such arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis, and you and TikTok are each waiving the right to resolution of disputes in a court of law by a judge or jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or consolidated action (and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, representative proceeding) (“Class Action Waiver”).​

​

​

​

(b) Exceptions to Arbitration​

​

Notwithstanding any other provision in TTS U.S. Cross-Border Seller Terms, this Arbitration Agreement will not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (a) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction, (b) injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's confidentiality rights or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights, and (c) claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law.​

​

​

​

(c) Governing Law and Rules​

​

The parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”) will govern its interpretation and enforcement. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, and the parties agree that the arbitrator (“Arbitrator”) will have exclusive authority to resolve threshold arbitrability disputes including those relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, validity or formation of this Arbitration Agreement. Any issue not governed by the FAA and AAA Rules will be resolved under the laws of the state of California to the fullest extent permitted by law.​

​

​

​

(d) Procedure​

​

A party that seeks to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration, as specified in the AAA Rules. The Arbitrator will be either (1) a single retired judge or (2) a single attorney licensed in the state of California, selected by the parties (or appointed by AAA if the parties cannot agree) from the AAA’s roster of commercial dispute arbitrators. Unless the parties otherwise agree or the Arbitrator otherwise requires, the arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles County, California, and claims that do not exceed $10,000 will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted by the parties. The Arbitrator will issue a reasoned, final, and binding decision, and judgment on the Arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having appropriate jurisdiction.​

​

​

​

(e) Severability​

​

If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, (ii) the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect, and (iii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis; provided that severance will not result in severing the Class Action Waiver in Section 8.8(a) in any manner that permits mass arbitration, to which the parties expressly do not consent.​

The provision of the Logistics Services by TikTok or its delegates or sub-contractors to You shall not be deemed, expressly or by implication, as a representation, warranty or endorsement by TikTok of the quality, legality, or compliance of the Product sold by You. You shall be solely responsible for the Product You sell to Buyer.​
