5.About the TikTok Shop​

What is the TikTok Shop?​

The TikTok Shop is a social e-commerce platform, which mainly allows Merchants to Offer Products to Users of the Platform. A User who buys a Product from a Merchant is a Buyer in these Terms. ​

The TikTok Shop allows Merchants to:​

* get access to seller center (“Seller Center”) and utilize the services/features We offer;​

* upload and manage Product information and listings for display to Users;​

* receive orders and conclude sales to Buyers;​

* track and manage orders and deliveries;​

* provide customer services to Buyers; ​

* establish promotion plans, e.g., through the affiliate feature; and​

* use other functionalities and features (e.g., Showcase) offered by TikTok Shop to Merchant.​

Further information about the features of the TikTok Shop can be found in the Seller University ([Singapore](https://seller-sg.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center), [Indonesia](https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1), [Malaysia](https://seller-my.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1), [the Philippines](https://seller-ph.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center), [Thailand](https://seller-th.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1), [UK](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=2), [Vietnam](https://seller-vn.tiktok.com/university/home?tab=policy_center&identity=1)).​

The contract for sale of the Product (the “Sale”) is always between the Merchant and the Buyer. You are responsible for compliance with all laws applicable to that Offer and Sale, both in the Buyer’s location and Your location (collectively, “Applicable Law”). You must also comply with the contract between you and the Buyer for the sale of Products (the “Terms of Sale”) – see here. It is a material breach of these Terms if You do not comply with Applicable Law or the [Terms of Sale](https://sf19-draftcdn-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/ies-hotsoon-draft-sg/magellan_ecommerce/ttec_tos_en.html).​

Who Can Use the TikTok Shop?​

IMPORTANT: ​

If You do authorise a third party to do this for You, You will remain responsible for all their activities on the TikTok Shop.​

Where Can You Use the TikTok Shop to Sell Products?​

Approved Merchants can use the TikTok Shop to Offer Products to Users located in any of the jurisdictions where the TikTok Shop is made available by TikTok from time to time. ​

6.How to Use the TikTok Shop​

How to register as a Merchant on TikTok Shop​

Before registering as a Merchant on the TikTok Shop, You will need to have a Platform account (“Account”). You will be asked to provide certain information (“Onboarding Information”) to TikTok during the registration process. We will use Your Onboarding Information to assess whether or not You will be authorised to use the TikTok Shop. If You are, You will be able to access Merchant functionality via the TikTok Shop. Instructions for registering as a Merchant and what Onboarding Information You will need to provide can be found in the TikTok Shop Seller Registration Guidelines ([Singapore](https://seller-sg.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10012299), [Indonesia](https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10000749&identity=1), [Malaysia](https://seller-my.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10008401), [the Philippines](https://seller-ph.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10009149), [Thailand](https://seller-th.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10008415), [UK](https://seller-uk.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10001420), [Vietnam](https://seller-vn.tiktok.com/university/article?knowledge_id=10008391)). It is a material breach of these Terms if You do not provide, and maintain at all times, complete and accurate Onboarding Information.​

As part of the registration process, if you are a Merchant based in China (including Hong Kong), You will also be required to provide a deposit to Us. We (or one of Our affiliates) will retain the deposit while You are a Merchant on the TikTok Shop. When reasonably required, We may use the deposit to protect TikTok, Buyers and Users in the event that You do not comply with these Terms, applicable laws, regulations or guidance, and/or any other applicable policies, rules or requirements, including but not limited to compensating TikTok where it has made payment to a Buyer as a result of Your conduct or Products. The amount of deposit payable may depend on the types of products that You intend to offer on the TikTok Shop. If a deduction is made from Your deposit, You will be required to submit further funds to cover the deduction and ensure that the full deposit amount is held by Us. The remaining balance of Your deposit will be returned to You when You are no longer a Merchant on the TikTok Shop. You will be fully responsible for any costs, fees or other expenses (including but not limited to losses due to currency conversion) incurred during the process of transferring Your deposit to Us and when We return the remaining balance of Your deposit to You. For full details of the deposit rules, please review the [TikTok Shop Cross-Border Shop Deposit Policy](https://seller.tiktokglobalshop.com/university/essay?knowledge_id=10011795&role=1&identity=1).​

​

TikTok is not liable for the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, negligence, or breaches of any Creator or any property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting therefrom and takes no responsibility whatsoever regarding the Creator Services rendered by Creators generally or to You specifically. ​
