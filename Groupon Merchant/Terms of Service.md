**15\. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING DEVICES**

When you use the Groupon Sites, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools and web server logs. As you use the Groupon Sites and applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information.

The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Groupon Sites by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.

For example, when you visit our Groupon Sites, Groupon and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. A “cookie” is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Groupon Sites. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your Groupon Sites activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Groupon Sites.

Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. “Session” cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases session cookies once you exit your browser. “Persistent” cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences.

Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.

We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access the Groupon Sites, your operating system type, mobile device model, unique device identification number, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Groupon Sites. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to the Groupon Sites and the website you visit after you leave the Groupon Sites, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.

In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways. For example, we use information we collect about Groupon Sites users to optimize our Groupon Sites and understand its traffic and usage patterns. Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive geo-location information, we will collect that automatically.

Groupon has relationships with third party advertising companies to place advertisements on our behalf onto other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for the Groupon Sites and our advertisements. These third parties may automatically collect information about your visit to the Groupon Sites and other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use to visit the Groupon Sites. They do this by using cookies, clear gifs and other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Groupon Sites and the other websites tracked by these third parties. Groupon is not responsible for cookies or clear gifs in third party ads. We encourage you to review the privacy policies or statements of these third party advertising companies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technologies.

**16\. WEBSITES OF OTHERS**

The Site may contain links to websites maintained by other parties not affiliates with Groupon. These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not because we endorse or have an opinion about the contents on such websites. We expressly disclaim any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such websites or the privacy practices of those websites. If you decide to access websites maintained by other parties, you do so at your own risk.

**17\. PUBLIC NATURE OF YOUR STATEMENTS**

You understand and agree that all Statements are public and not private. Any other person (whether or not a user of Groupon’s services) may read your Statements without your knowledge. Please do not include any Personal Information (as defined in our Privacy Statement) in your Statements. Groupon does not control or endorse any Statement found in any part of the Communities, and we specifically disclaim any liability concerning the Statements and the Communities and any actions resulting from your participation in any part of the Communities, including any objectionable content. Any and all Statements you post to our Groupon Sites are not confidential.

**18\. LICENSE GRANT**

By posting Statements or other information on or through the Communities, you grant Groupon a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, and display the Statements alone or as part of other works in any form, media, or technology whether now known or hereafter developed without territorial or time limitations, and to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees. Your license of any Statements or information submitted above extends to use for promotions, advertising, market research or any other lawful purpose, without limitation.

**19\. INDEMNIFICATION/RELEASE**

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Groupon, its subsidiaries, affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to any products or services provided by you in connection with the Groupon Sites, your Statements, or any use of the Site in violation of these Terms of Use. You are solely responsible for your interactions with your customers and other users of the Groupon Sites. To the extent permitted under applicable laws, you hereby release Groupon from any and all claims or liability related to any product or service you make or offer to End Users, your Statements, any action or inaction by you, including your failure to comply with applicable law and/or failure to abide by the terms of a Groupon, and any conduct or speech, whether online or offline, of any other user or merchant.

**20\. CHOICE OF LAW; FORUM**

Any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms of Use and/or any use by you of the Groupon Sites or Groupon’s services shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to its choice of law rules and without regard to conflicts of laws principles. You and Groupon irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in Cook County, Illinois, USA, for all proceedings in court under these Terms of Use.

**21\. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES**

No waiver by either you or Groupon of any breach or default or failure to exercise any right allowed under these Terms of Use is a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default or a waiver or forfeiture of any similar or future rights under our Agreement. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall be of no legal force or effect. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of these Terms of Use invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions contained in these Terms of Use, and the remaining portions of these Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect.
