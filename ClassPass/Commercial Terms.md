    ClassPass Spain SL, (**ClassPass**,” “**we**” or “**us**”) is pleased to include you in our roster of Partners on the ClassPass website at [www.classpass.com](https://www.classpass.com/) (together with any iPhone®, Android® or other mobile application of such website, our “**Website**”). Please read these Terms and Conditions (the “**Terms**”), and let us know if you have any questions. These Terms are incorporated into the Partner Agreement (if any) and any other agreement between you (“**Partner**” or “**you**”) and ClassPass (collectively, this “**Agreement**”). While we may modify this Agreement pursuant to the Miscellaneous section of the Terms below (including the Partner Agreement and/or these Terms) without advance notice to you, we will give you prompt notice of any material changes, as set forth in the Miscellaneous section below. You also may contact us at any time to receive a copy of the most current version of these Terms. By signing the Partner Agreement or otherwise accepting these Terms, you agree to be bound by these Terms, which apply to all locations, classes and services you make available via the ClassPass platform, unless otherwise communicated or agreed upon by ClassPass.
    
*   ### 1\. ACCOUNT SET-UP & DOCUMENTATION.
    
    1.  _Bank Account Information_. As part of the onboarding process, you will be given access to our online payment system to provide your bank account information (“**Bank Account**”). Once your Bank Account has been verified, we (or a third party on our behalf) will make payments to you hereunder by electronic transfer, which may be an international transfer, to your Bank Account via an automated clearing house payment system (ACH), or through an equivalent or alternative payment method in our discretion. You are solely responsible for updating our on-line payment system as to any changes in your Bank Account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate account information and any identifying information we request, including your legal company name, street address, e-mail address, bank account, relevant tax information and such other information as may be requested by ClassPass (or its third party service providers) (collectively, “Account Information”). You are responsible for the accuracy and timely updating of Account Information, and you agree to promptly notify ClassPass in writing if any Account Information changes. You agree that ClassPass has no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any loss or damage caused, either directly or indirectly, by inaccurate Account Information. You shall also be solely responsible for maintaining the security of any account, Account Information, and account credentials you have access to in connection with this Agreement, including passwords and files, and for all uses of any such account or Account Information. You shall be responsible for the acts or omissions of any person who accesses the Platform using passwords or access procedures provided to or created by ClassPass.
    2.  _Tax or Similar Forms_. You will provide ClassPass with any requested tax or similar forms necessary in connection with your participation in ClassPass. We may withhold applicable amounts from payments due to you hereunder until such time as we have received this information.
    3.  _Participation_. Your classes or other services will be made available for use by ClassPass members after you are launched on our Website. Partner shall maintain minimum inventory levels throughout the term to help ensure consistent user experience. Partner shall accord the same preferences and priorities to reservations made via ClassPass as reservations made by Partner's clients/members. In addition, Partner shall not cancel a ClassPass reservation except where the class or service itself has been cancelled. As part of participating in the Website, ClassPass shall have access to all Partner spots and you agree to use ClassPass’s SmartTools, such as those with respect to inventory allocation. We continually update and test various aspects of the ClassPass platform and may include or exclude you from these tests. We may include you as a participant in new features, offerings and tools that ClassPass makes available as part of the ClassPass platform. We will notify you if you are able to opt-out out of participating. We reserve the right to limit the inventory or number of classes, services and/or spots available.
    4.  _Partner’s ClassPass Assets_. You are responsible for ensuring that descriptions, photos, assets and materials relating to your services, classes, brand, and business do not contain any content that is misleading or otherwise fails to comply with applicable law.
    5.  _Policies_. You agree to comply with ClassPass policies and guidelines applicable to the ClassPass platform.
*   ### 2\. PAYMENTS, EXCLUSIVITY & REPORTING
    
    1.  _Payments for Qualifying Classes_. As full and complete payment for all goods and services you provide to us hereunder, ClassPass will pay you the applicable rate(s) as set forth in the Partner Agreement for each Qualifying Class. A “**Qualifying Class**” means a class or service at Partner booked by one of our users through our Website or by ClassPass that: (a) was attended by a ClassPass user, (b) was missed (i.e. not attended and also not canceled through our Website), or (c) was Late Canceled and not subsequently rebooked via ClassPass. “**Late Canceled**” means a class or service canceled within 12 hours of class time (provided that if your cancellation policy permits cancellation without penalty with less than 12 hours notice, your shorter cancellation policy will apply). For the avoidance of doubt, attendances that are not booked by us or through our Website, such as last-minute walk-ins, do not count as Qualifying Classes. We will communicate any cost that may apply to your use of any upgrades, products, services or features we may release from time to time.
        
    2.  _Exclusivity_. You agree not to participate in any subscription, membership, package, site or app that make available fitness, wellness, or other experiential offerings from more than one provider (whether business-to-business or direct-to-consumer) or that is otherwise similar to ClassPass. You acknowledge that this commitment is. You acknowledge that this commitment is appropriate in light of the benefits of working with ClassPass and its efforts to offer the most robust experience possible for members. ClassPass reserves the right to determine whether a service or offering may be in conflict with your obligation under this provision.
        
    3.  _Reports & Payment Date_. Payments for Qualifying Classes booked in a particular month will be issued to you periodically (but in no case later than 15 business days after the last day of that month). Payments for Qualifying Classes are calculated based on data contained in the Partner dashboard (that we make available to you so you can monitor your account) and as such will be the final determinant of payment. You should review and monitor your account regularly. In the event that you discover any discrepancies between the data in the Partner dashboard and our payment, you must notify us of such discrepancies within 30 days after the last day of the month in which there is a discrepancy.
        
    4.  _Reconciliation_. We have 90 days after each payment to you to make reconciliation adjustments, such as in respect of classes that were cancelled but where we have remitted payment to you. We may credit any overpayments made against any other payments due to you hereunder. In addition, in the event of a payment dispute, you agree to provide us information and materials we reasonably request to confirm that our payments to you are correct.
        
    5.  _Banking Authorization_. You authorize us to initiate ACH (or equivalent) credit transaction entries to your Bank Account. You hereby acknowledge that our origination of all ACH transactions to your Bank Account must comply with provisions of applicable law. Please note that ACH payments may take up to seven (7) business days to become available in your Bank Account after processing.
        
    6.  _Fraud_. In no event will Partner be entitled to earn payments for (and if paid, ClassPass will be entitled to reimbursement for) standard reservations, Digital Content reservations, user purchases, or for anything else in cases of Partner’s fraud, bad faith, or other misconduct (including for reservations booked using a ClassPass free or discounted trial by any Person Partner inappropriately encouraged or incentivized or by Partner’s employees, staff, contractors, agents, family members, or friends, or otherwise made illegitimately in connection with fraud, bad faith, or in violation of ClassPass’ user terms) in ClassPass’ determination.
        
*   ### 3\. MEMBER VISITS; FEES PAYABLE BY MEMBERS.
    
    Except as provided in the next sentence, you agree not to charge ClassPass members for any fees associated with attending classes and/or obtaining services booked through our Website or by ClassPass. The only charges which you may impose on our members in connection with classes and/or services booked through our Website or by ClassPass are equipment use or rental fees, and then only if such fees expressly have been disclosed to ClassPass in advance in writing not less than seven (7) days prior to the member’s reservation. Partner must not charge ClassPass members any fee that is not being charged to Partner’s existing and regular clients. We reserve the right to credit our members for any fees improperly assessed against them and then to apply such credits against payments otherwise due to you from ClassPass. You acknowledge and agree that ClassPass is not liable for any payments that may be due to you directly from our members.

*   ### 13\. DIGITAL.
    
    1.  Digital Content. ClassPass may enable partners to make livestream and/or pre-recorded audio, video, and/or other digital content (collectively, “**Digital Content**”) available through the Website or other platforms. You grant ClassPass and its affiliates all rights needed to use the Digital Content and associated intellectual property (including to modify, reproduce, publicly display, distribute, broadcast, transmit, stream, publish, publicly perform, record, transfer, and sublicense it) worldwide in all applicable media and formats currently existing or hereinafter developed (including ClassPass’ platform and applicable third parties’ streaming, conferencing, and hosting services).
        
    2.  _Representations_. You represent, warrant, and covenant that (i) you have and will maintain all rights needed from all applicable third parties, including streaming and conferencing services, Digital Content rightsholders and contributors, such as photographers, videographers, instructors, and actors, and owners of musical compositions and sound recordings, for you, ClassPass, and applicable third parties to lawfully use the Digital Content; (ii) no action or payment is or will be needed from ClassPass to lawfully use the Digital Content; (iii) your Digital Content does not and will not contain any material that is illegal, hateful, obscene, unsafe, harmful, or otherwise inappropriate; and (iv) you will take measures needed to respect users’ privacy and rights, including adequately explaining the default settings of any streaming or conferencing system you use.

    3.  _Payments for Digital_. For each legitimate and bona fide livestream Digital Content session that a ClassPass user purchases to reserve or reserves using credits through the Website and successfully attended, you’ll earn the rate applicable to the livestream Digital Content for the applicable time period reflected in ClassPass’ systems (such as the Partner dashboard), unless we agree otherwise in writing. The rate must not be higher than Partner’s direct rate for the offering, and ClassPass is entitled to reimbursement if ClassPass pays a higher rate. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary herein or in your Partner Agreement, unless we otherwise agree in writing:
        
        i. no payment for Digital Content will be earned (and if paid, ClassPass will be entitled to reimbursement) for reservations that are, in ClassPass’ determination: (1) not attended; (2) booked illegitimately (including using a ClassPass free or discounted trial by any Person you inappropriately encouraged or incentivized or by your employees, staff, contractors, agents, family members, or friends, or otherwise booked illegitimately or in connection with fraud, bad faith, or in violation of ClassPass’ user terms); or (3) for non-livestream content (such as pre-recorded content); and
        
        ii. the definition of Qualifying Classes above (and the rates and payment schedule applicable to Qualifying Classes) do not apply to Digital Content.
        
    4.  _Miscellaneous_. If a user reserves a Digital Content spot through ClassPass during the term of your Partner Agreement, you agree to fulfill it. ClassPass will determine the categorization, placement, layout and presentation of the Digital Content. Partner agrees to comply with ClassPass’ guidelines (e.g., regarding formatting) in order to facilitate featuring the Digital Content. ClassPass is not obligated to use or store all or any portion of Digital Content. Nothing in this Section (Digital) limits ClassPass’ rights under other sections of the Terms. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary herein or in any other agreement between ClassPass and Partner, no single reservation will warrant two payments (so for example, if Partner sells livestream class packs through ClassPass, Partner would not earn payments for both the pack as a whole and the single reservations), and all revenue that Partner earns or receives (or has earned or received) from ClassPass (from Digital Content and/or any other offerings) will count towards any revenue guarantees, and will be recoupable in connection with any prepayments, that ClassPass makes or has made to Partner.

    1.  _Add-on Program._ ClassPass may enable partners to participate in its Add-on program, through which partners are paid up front for partner offerings purchased by users through ClassPass, rather than being paid on a per-reservation basis as individual classes or sessions are attended.
        
    2.  _Payment Terms._
        
        i. Partner Revenue for Qualifying Add-on Purchases. If you participate in the Add-on program:
        
        A. For each Qualifying Add-on Purchase completed on or before August 31, 2020 at 11:59pm ET, you will earn the full amount that ClassPass retains from such purchase (up to the amount of the applicable Partner Retail Rate, which is the maximum), which includes any applicable tax, except as otherwise stated herein or agreed in writing.
        
        B. For each Qualifying Add-on Purchase completed after August 31, 2020 at 11:59pm ET, you will earn 76.5% of the Partner Retail Rate, which includes any applicable tax, except as otherwise stated herein or agreed in writing.
        
        C. If you earn revenue for a Qualifying Add-on Purchase in accordance with this section, individual classes or sessions reserved in connection with the Add-on will not count as Qualifying Classes, and you will not earn revenue or any form of compensation for such reservations other than the revenue described in this section.
        
        ii. Pricing Integrity. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in the Terms or in any agreement between Partner and ClassPass: You are responsible for providing true and accurate information about your pricing. If the pricing you provide (or the pricing on which your payouts are based) is higher than the pricing you’ve used in non-ClassPass channels, your earned revenue (and your rates going forward) may be reduced accordingly, and for any overpayments already made, ClassPass shall be entitled to either receive reimbursement from you for the difference between the amount paid to you and the amount you should have earned, or to deduct such difference from payments to you.
        
        iii. Payment Schedule. Payments for Qualifying Add-on Purchases will be sent periodically, within 15 business days after the last day of the month.
        
        iv. Refunds/Reimbursements. If Partner or Partner’s personnel receives a cancellation or refund request, Partner should contact ClassPass and not provide a refund directly or take any other responsive action, unless ClassPass provides written instructions to the contrary. ClassPass may issue refunds to users as required by law or in its discretion. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in the Agreement, if ClassPass issues (or confirms that it is planning to issue) a full or partial refund to a purchaser of your Add-on, ClassPass shall have the right to be reimbursed for the applicable amount by Partner or to deduct the applicable amount from payments to Partner in ClassPass’ discretion; and if ClassPass requests that Partner issue a refund to a user directly instead of reimbursing ClassPass, Partner shall follow ClassPass’ instructions. Partner’s obligations under this section shall apply in all events, including if you are not able to provide the applicable service.
        
    3.  _Fulfillment._
        
        i. Reservations. Unless otherwise agreed by ClassPass in writing, users must make reservations through the ClassPass platform (rather than directly with Partner).
        
        ii. Access. Partner shall grant ClassPass and its users equal or greater access to Partner’s venues, schedules, classes, other offerings, and spots as Partner’s other customers; Partner shall not grant any direct customer access broader than that granted to ClassPass users. Partner shall enable every user who purchases an Add-on to redeem all sessions associated with it without restriction, pursuant to the terms communicated to the user at point of purchase through ClassPass and the terms herein (including not charging users for access, activation, or any other fees or costs, not requiring any minimum term commitment, where applicable, allowing unlimited access to facilities, and otherwise) through the end of the redemption period communicated to such user at point of purchase through ClassPass, notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement or any other event.
        
    4.  _Business Responsibility._ Partner shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable laws relating to the operation of its business and sales of its offerings, including ensuring that users sign any applicable membership agreement and/or other legally required documentation upon arrival at Partner’s facilities or otherwise.
        
    5.  _Definitions._ **“Add-on”** refers to a Partner class package, recurring membership, or other Partner offering as made available to users through ClassPass pursuant to terms that are communicated to such users through the ClassPass platform. **“Partner Retail Rate”** is the lowest price for which the direct Partner offering corresponding to the Add-on has been made available by Partner directly to its own customers or through other non-ClassPass channels up to and including the date of the Qualifying Add-on Purchase, or if there is no corresponding offering that Partner makes available directly, a price that ClassPass determines based on the pricing of other comparable offerings. **“Qualifying Add-on Purchase”** is a user’s valid and complete purchase of a partner offering through the ClassPass platform as a part of the Add-on program.
        
*   ### 15\. MISCELLANEOUS.
