If Merchant is required to make such a deduction or withhold such tax, the sum payable by Merchant shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that Uber Ireland receives a sum net of any withholding or deduction equal to the sum which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made or required to be made.

*   1.  Retail Price of Items and Taxes.

*   *   1.  Merchant is the "retailer" or "seller" of all Items (including delivery services related to such Items, if using the Aggregator Delivery Method). Merchant is responsible for determining and setting the original listed price, prior to any discounts or promotions, for each Item to be made available for sale via the Uber Eats App (the "Retail Price"). The Retail Price for each Item will include VAT, and Merchant is solely responsible for determining and setting the rate of applicable VAT to be charged to Customers for Items available on the Uber Eats App. To the extent that Merchant does not inform Uber of the applicable VAT rate, Merchant expressly authorizes Uber to make such determination on its behalf and Merchant hereby acknowledges and agrees that Uber will have no liability for the accuracy of any such determination. Merchant expressly authorizes Uber, at Merchant’s direction, to collect such VAT on Merchant’s behalf.

*   *   1.  Merchant is solely responsible for accounting for the applicable VAT chargeable in connection with the sale of Items. 

1.  **Invoices.** Merchant grants a mandate to Uber, pursuant to which, for each order completed using the Uber Eats App, Uber may issue an invoice and/or receipt for Items and (in the Aggregator Delivery Method) delivery services to Customers in Merchant's name and on Merchant’s behalf provided that Merchant has completed the required Invoice Details. Merchant may dispute invoices and/or receipts issued by Uber on Merchant's behalf within a period not exceeding three (3) days from the issuance date of the invoice and/or receipt. Failing this, Merchant is deemed to have validated said invoice and/or receipt. It is understood that Merchant will carry out storing and archiving of invoices and/or receipts in compliance with Applicable Laws.
2.  **Method Restrictions and Limitations.**
    1.  Method Settings. If Merchant has selected both the Aggregator Method and the Marketplace Method, Merchant may select Aggregator Method and/or Marketplace Method for delivery of future orders of Items to its Customers. Merchant may apply its selections to some or all future orders. Merchant may modify its Method selection at any time. However, the selected Method for an order cannot be modified after the order has been placed. All orders pending at the time Merchant modifies its Method must be completed via the Method selected when the order was placed. The proper Method for each order will be reflected in Merchant’s order dashboard available via the Uber Tools. Uber may, at its discretion, modify delivery settings on Merchant’s behalf.
    2.  Delivery Radius Modification. Uber, at its discretion, reserves the right to modify Merchant’s delivery radius for reasons including, without limitation, to prevent or otherwise limit unfulfilled orders.
    3.  Temporary Usage Restriction. Uber, at its discretion, reserves the right to restrict or otherwise limit Merchant’s access to the Uber Eats App for a period of time for reasons including, without limitation, to prevent or otherwise limited unfulfilled orders
    4.  Transfer Restrictions. The following restricted items may not be transferred via the Uber Eats App: people or animals of any size, illegal items, fragile items, dangerous items (like weapons, explosives, flammables, etc.), stolen goods, or any items that Merchant does not have permission to transfer. Uber Ireland reserves the right to prohibit transfer of additional Items at its sole discretion.
3.  **Marks**.
    1.  Marks. Subject to this Agreement, each party hereby grants to the other party (and, in the case of Uber, to its Affiliates) a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable license during the Term to use such party’s respective Marks, on a royalty free basis, in connection with the activities related to this Agreement. This license includes the right to reproduce, adapt and represent (in connection with all or part of the activities related to this Agreement) the Marks for the entire world, using all means and media, and without any restriction of any kind as regards exploitation methods, number of prints, dissemination or utilisation. All uses of a party’s Marks (owned or licensed, as applicable) by the other party will be in the form and format specified or approved by the party that owns (or is a licensee of, as applicable) such Marks. Other than as specifically set forth in this Agreement, neither party will use the other party’s Marks without the prior, express, written consent of the other party. Any use or display of Merchant’s Marks by Uber in connection with making Items available through the Uber Eats App in the ordinary course of business will not require any such prior, express, written consent. All goodwill related to the use of a party’s Marks by the other party will inure to the benefit of the party that owns (or is a licensee of, as applicable) such Marks. Except as expressly set forth herein, neither party will be deemed to grant the other party any license or rights under any intellectual property or other proprietary rights. All rights not granted are expressly reserved. Merchant agrees that it will not, and will ensure that Aggregator Couriers do not, try to register or otherwise use and/or claim ownership in any of the Uber Marks, alone or in combination with other letters, punctuation, words, symbols and/or designs, or in any confusingly similar mark, name or title, for any goods and services.
4.  **Marketing and Promotional Activities**.

*   1.  Marketing. Uber may showcase the availability of Merchant’s Items via the Uber Eats App through various promotional activities including, without limitation, social media channels, websites, advertisements, blogs or other media available now or hereinafter created. Uber (or a party designated by Uber acting on Uber’s behalf) may create video, still images and/or other materials for marketing and other efforts related to the Uber Eats App ("Uber Eats Marketing Materials"). Merchant agrees that Uber Eats Marketing Materials (including, without limitation, all intellectual property rights therein) are and will remain the sole and exclusive property of Uber. Additionally, if Merchant Merchant Marketing Materials are used in connection with the display of Merchant’s Items on the Uber Eats App, Merchant hereby grants Uber a non-exclusive, royalty free right to use, reproduce, adapt, represent, and display such Merchant Marketing Materials in connection with Merchant’s Items and other promotional activities relating to the Uber Eats Services, for the entire world, during the Term, using all means and media, and without any restriction other than as required by Applicable Law as regards exploitation methods, number of prints, dissemination or utilisation.
    2.  No Additional Amounts. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that, through advertising and marketing, Uber may seek to attract new merchants to Uber Eats and to increase existing users of the Uber Eats Services and Uber Eats App. Merchant acknowledges and agrees such advertising or marketing does not entitle Merchant to any additional monetary amounts beyond the amounts expressly stated in this Agreement.  
        
    3.  Merchant Promotional Offers. Uber may authorize Merchant to use certain automated tools that allow Merchant to provide promotional Offers to Customers through the Uber Eats App in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Merchant agrees that it is solely responsible for fulfilling and, subject to technical and functional limitations of the automated tools, defining the Offers provided by Merchant to its Customers.
        1.  Merchant Promotional Offers. Subject to this Agreement and any other guidelines or eligibility criteria for Offers that Uber may make available from time to time, Uber hereby authorizes Merchant to use Uber’s proprietary, automated tools ("Offer Tools") to create and provide Offers to Customers. Unless otherwise specified by Uber, Merchant will be solely responsible for defining each Offer (within the scope of functionality provided by the Offer Tools), including, without limitation, the start date, end date, and budget for each Offer. Each Offer will be subject to Uber’s prior written approval. Merchant is responsible for providing to Uber Offer Materials in a format and within deadlines specified by Uber for such to be reproduced for the provision of the Offer to Customers.
        2.  Enhanced Promotional Placements. Subject to Uber Eats App functionality, Uber may provide enhanced promotional placement or other visual treatment for the Offers through the start and end date identified by Merchant. Merchant acknowledges that the time period of enhanced promotional placement for an Offer (if applicable) may vary due to a number of factors including Merchant’s budget, the start and end date for an Offer, and other Uber Eats App functionality.
        3.  Merchant’s Responsibilities. Merchant will honor and fulfill the terms of the Offer. Merchant represents and warrants that Merchant will run all Offers in accordance with all Applicable Laws which apply to the Offers. Merchant represents and warrants that Merchant possesses all necessary authority, rights, licenses, consents and permissions to run the Offer (including, without limitation, the rights to any Offer Materials provided to Uber). Merchant will not use an Offer to make charitable donations. For free or reduced Delivery Charge Offers, Merchant will be solely responsible for the reduction to the amount that Uber collects from Customers with respect to the Delivery Charge.
        4.  Reporting and Offer Costs. Uber will use good faith efforts to provide Merchant with reasonable information regarding Merchant's Offers, which may include, without limitation, the Offer Costs and the number of Items sold in connection with an Offer. Uber, in its sole discretion, may highlight Offers and/or the results of Offer in its own marketing materials.
        5.  Service Fees. For Items where an Offer has been applied as a discount to the Retail Price of the Item, Uber Ireland will charge Merchant a Service Fee based on the discounted Retail Price and not the full Retail Price. If Merchant's Offer consists of a discount on delivery, the Service Fee will be calculated as described in the Agreement and will not change. Merchant agrees that Merchant is solely responsible for Offer Costs and that Uber Ireland may deduct Offer Costs from Merchant's Item Revenue. If Merchant is paid for an Item, it is responsible for the Service Fee and relevant Offer Costs.
        6.  Modification, Suspension, Discontinuation. Uber reserves the right, at any time, temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, to modify, suspend or discontinue the Offer Tools or the ability for Merchant to provide Offers. Merchant agrees that neither Uber nor any of its Affiliates shall be liable to Merchant (or to any third party) for the Offer or the Offer Tools, including for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Offer or the Offer Tools or providing Merchant with the ability to provide Offers.  
            
    4.  Ranking. We may use certain parameters to determine how prominently Merchants appear in the Uber Eats App (the “Parameters”). These Parameters are selected to optimise the marketplace experience for all users of the Uber Eats App, including you, Customers and Couriers. The main Parameters used for ranking include the time you have been on the Uber Eats App, customer preferences (evidenced, for example, by previous orders, searches or clicks), cuisine types, promotional offers, contextual factors (for example, the time of day, the day of the week), past ordering experiences (based, for example, on feedback, acceptance of orders and preparation time), availability, pricing, profitability (for Uber), basket size, estimated delivery time, delivery zone and any paid advertising you place on the Uber Eats App. The Parameters are taken into account any time merchants are displayed in the Uber Eats App, including in response to a Customer's search query and in the home feed. You can influence how prominently you appear in the Uber Eats App by making promotional offers, placing paid advertising, and receiving positive feedback from Customers and Couriers. Uber shall provide you with fifteen (15) days’ notice of important changes to the Parameters.
    5.  Publicity. Except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement or otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, neither party may issue a press release or otherwise refer to the other party in any manner with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, without the prior written consent of such other party.

3.  **Indemnification**.
    1.  Indemnified Claims. Each party (the "Indemnifying Party") will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, causes of action, and losses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) (collectively, "Losses") with respect to any third party claim arising out of or related to: (i) the negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party or its employees or agents (in Merchant’s case, including Aggregator Couriers but excluding Uber and Marketplace Couriers to the extent they are Merchant’s agents) in their performance of this Agreement; (ii) any claims that, if true, would be a breach of any of the Indemnifying Party’s (in Merchant’s case, including via Aggregator Couriers) representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement; and (iii) any claims that the Indemnifying Party’s Marks infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, as long as such Marks have been used in the manner approved by the Indemnifying Party.

**5\. Payment services provided by Uber Payments on behalf of Uber**

5.1 Uber Payments enables the Partner to receive payments from the User or another Partner for Services that the Partner provides through an Uber Platform. The Partner therefore agrees that Uber Payments will accept and process payment transactions, including E-money transactions. More specifically, Uber Payments receives any funds due by the User or another Partner (the Partner Charges) or Uber (the Uber Amounts) on behalf of the Partner. Upon receiving the funds, Uber Payments deducts any applicable Fees and pays out the remainder to the Partner (the Pay-out Amount) as set-out in Article 7.

5.2 Uber Payments administers the Pay-out Amount in the name of the Partner. Uber Payments will only transfer the Pay-out Amount to a Partner (Pay-out) if it has received the full amount (including Fees) from a User or another Partner or another payment service provider (and in the event of an Uber Amount, from Uber) for the Services and if such transfer is in accordance with the Agreement and the Payments Terms.

**6\. Partner Charges and P2P Charges**

  
6.1 On behalf of Uber, Uber Payments will collect the Partner Charges due to the Partner for the Services provided. Any such Partner Charges will be received by the Custodian or, if received by Uber Payments, be transferred to the Custodian as soon as possible.

6.2 Uber Payments will transfer the P2P Charge for the provided Services on behalf of the Partner that owes the P2P Charge to the Partner to which the P2P Charge is due (for which latter Partner Uber Payments receives the P2P Charge as a Partner Charge).

6.3 Uber Payments will transfer the Pay-out Amount to the Partner in the currency in which the Partner Charge was received by the Custodian.

The Partner represents and warrants that the bank account designated by it on the Uber Platform is a bank account administered in its own name.  
  
6.5 The Partner authorizes Uber Payments to use the Partner Charges (including for the avoidance of doubt, the P2P Charge) to satisfy all claims of Uber or third parties vis-à-vis the Partner under or pursuant to the Agreement and/or the Payments Terms. Uber Payments is authorized to deduct the amount of such claims from the Partner Charges and transfer such amounts to Uber and itself. Uber Payments shall in this respect be entitled to solely rely on the information it receives from Uber as binding evidence of such amounts due by the Partner. The Partner may provide evidence to the contrary.

**7. Pay-out**

7.1 Uber, Uber Payments and the Partner can agree that Pay-out takes place on a specific incidental or recurring date. Such agreement constitutes an instruction for Pay-out. Such instruction for Pay-out will be regarded as having been received by Uber Payments on the moment that the Partner indicates on the relevant Uber Platform that it wishes to receive Pay-out and the agreement to that instruction has been confirmed by Uber on its behalf and on behalf of Uber Payments.

9.3 Uber Payments will not be liable for Pay-outs if the Partner provides an incorrect IBAN. The Partner may request Uber Payments to assist in retrieving the amount transferred to an incorrect IBAN provided by the Partner, in which case Uber Payments will undertake reasonable efforts to assist the Partner, including providing the Partner with relevant information in Uber Payments' possession that the Partner needs for reclaiming the amounts paid.

**SPECIFIC SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS**

The following Specific Supplemental Terms govern the use of the Marketplace Method and the general availability of Items via the Uber Eats App delivered to Customers by Marketplace Couriers ("Marketplace Items"). All undefined, capitalized terms will have the meaning set forth in the Order Form, the Definitions or the General Supplemental Terms.

1.  **Marketplace Items**. Upon Merchant agreeing to the Order Form, Definitions, General Supplemental Terms and Specific Supplemental Terms governing the Marketplace Method, and contingent upon completion of any additional verification steps, the Uber Tools will be made available to Merchant to access and request on-demand delivery services performed by Marketplace Couriers. The Uber Eats Services in connection with the Marketplace Method include, without limitation: (a) providing on-demand lead generation, logistics, payment processing, marketing, onboarding, operational and other support services in connection with the sale of Marketplace Items by Merchant via the Uber Eats App; and (b) enabling Merchant to access and request on-demand delivery services performed by Marketplace Couriers.
2.  **Payment**.
    1.  Marketplace Service Fee. In consideration for the Uber Eats Services in connection with the Marketplace Method, Uber Ireland will charge Merchant a Marketplace Service Fee in the amount set out in the Order Form for each Marketplace Item sold by Merchant via the Uber Eats App. Uber Ireland will calculate the Marketplace Service Fee as follows: the Retail Price of the Item(s) sold by Merchant via the Uber Eats App (including any VAT or other sales tax) (the "Marketplace Item Payment") multiplied by the Marketplace Service Fee percentage. The Marketplace Service Fee shall be deemed to be exclusive of VAT).
    2.  Marketplace Cash Orders. Uber Ireland may facilitate a delivery option to Customers in the Territory that allows them to pay for a given Marketplace Item provided by Merchant and all associated fees and charges resulting from that transaction in cash (a "Marketplace Cash Order").
    3.  Collections. Notwithstanding the appointment of Uber and/or its Affiliates by Merchant as its limited payment collection agent under the Agreement, in the event of a Marketplace Cash Order request by a Customer, Merchant authorizes a Marketplace Courier to collect the Marketplace Item Payment sold by Merchant via the Uber Eats App (including any VAT or other sales tax). The Marketplace Courier shall be notified of the funds to be collected by the Marketplace Courier ("Marketplace Cash Collections"), exclusive of any gratuities, in the Uber Eats App. Uber’s and/or its Affiliates' role as Merchant’s agent with regard to Marketplace Cash Collections shall be to collect the Marketplace Item Payment and Uber Ireland’s Marketplace Service Fee from Marketplace Couriers by either obtaining the funds electronically or offsetting such amounts from funds otherwise due to Marketplace Couriers from their delivery services in aggregate generated on the Uber Eats App. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that collection shall be the responsibility of the Marketplace Courier. If for whatever reason Marketplace Courier’s electronic payment to Uber and/or its Affiliates is delayed or unsuccessful, Uber and/or its Affiliates, in its capacity as Merchant’s collection agent, will act as a fall-back and ensure receipt of payment by Merchant. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that in consideration of Uber Ireland’s provision of lead generation, demand prediction, and other related services provided via the Uber Eats App under the Agreement, Merchant owes Uber Ireland the respective Marketplace Service Fee, regardless of collections related to the attempted or completed deliveries.

With each payment statement, Uber shall report any offsetting and deductions.
    4.  Revenue Transfer. Uber and/or its Affiliates will transfer to Merchant the total Marketplace Item Payment (including any VAT or other sales tax collected on Merchant’s behalf) earned by Merchant, less less the Marketplace Service Fee and any refunds given on behalf of Merchant to Customers (such final transferred amount being the "Marketplace Item Revenue"). The Marketplace Item Revenue will be transferred on a bi-weekly basis. 
3.  **Batched Trips**. Uber may, at its sole discretion, request for one Marketplace Courier to deliver orders to multiple Customers as part of the same trip ("Batched Trips"). Batched Trips may include multiple orders from Merchant, or one or more orders from Merchant combined with one or more orders from other merchants using the Uber Eats App.

    2.  Aggregator Delivery Services.

If Merchant is paid for an order, Merchant is responsible for the Aggregator Service Fee even if an Aggregator Courier is unable to complete the delivery. If applicable, Merchant authorizes Uber and/or its Affiliates to collect a delivery charge from Customers on its behalf (the "Aggregator Delivery Charge").
    3.  Aggregator Cash Deliveries. Uber may facilitate a delivery option to Customers that allows them to pay for a given Aggregator Item provided by Merchant and all associated fees and charges resulting from that transaction in cash (an "Aggregator Cash Order").

The Aggregator Item Revenue will be transferred on a bi-weekly basis.
    5.  No Additional Amounts. Merchant acknowledges that the Aggregator Item Payment and, where applicable, the Aggregator Delivery Charge is full payment for the Items and delivery services provided to Customers, although the Uber Eats Services may provide Customers with the ability to apply a gratuity through the Uber Eats Services. With regard to cash gratuities provided by a Customer directly to an Aggregator Courier, no portion of that gratuity is owed to or should be paid to Uber.
3.  **Aggregator Delivery Terms**.
    1.  Provision of Delivery Services. If Merchant chooses for delivery services to be fulfilled by an Aggregator Courier, Merchant will need to provide the Aggregator Courier with certain Customer Information provided to Merchant through the Uber Tools, including (as applicable) the drop-off location of the applicable Items to be delivered and the name and phone number of the Customer.

Merchant represents and warrants that it shall not, and shall ensure that all Aggregator Couriers do not, contact any Customers or use any of the Customer’s Personal Data collected in the course of providing the delivery services for any reason other than for the purposes of fulfilling delivery services.

    3.  Merchant’s Relationship with Uber. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that Uber’s provision to Merchant of the Uber Eats Services creates a legal and direct business relationship between Merchant and Uber. Uber does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control Merchant or its Aggregator Couriers generally or in its or their performance under this Agreement specifically, including in connection with the operation of its business, the provision of delivery services, the acts or omissions of Aggregator Couriers, or the operation and maintenance of any Transportation Method.
