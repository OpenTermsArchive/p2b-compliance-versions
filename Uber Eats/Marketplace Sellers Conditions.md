* 1. Retail Price of Items and Taxes.

* * 1. Merchant is the "retailer" or "seller" of all Items (including delivery services related to such Items, if using the Aggregator Delivery Method). Merchant is responsible for determining and setting the original listed price, prior to any discounts or promotions, for each Item to be made available for sale via the Uber Eats App (the "Retail Price"). The Retail Price for each Item will include VAT, and Merchant is solely responsible for determining and setting the rate of applicable VAT to be charged to Customers for Items available on the Uber Eats App. To the extent that Merchant does not inform Uber of the applicable VAT rate, Merchant expressly authorizes Uber to make such determination on its behalf and Merchant hereby acknowledges and agrees that Uber will have no liability for the accuracy of any such determination. Merchant expressly authorizes Uber, at Merchant’s direction, to collect such VAT on Merchant’s behalf.

* * 1. Merchant is solely responsible for accounting for the applicable VAT chargeable in connection with the sale of Items. 

1. **Invoices.** Merchant grants a mandate to Uber for the entirety of the Term, pursuant to which Uber may act as follows:
    1. For each order completed using the Uber Eats App, Uber may issue an invoice and/or receipt for Items and (in the Aggregator Delivery Method) delivery services to Customers in Merchant's name and on Merchant’s behalf (“Customer Invoices”) provided that Merchant has completed the required Invoice Details, including on the relevant Uber Tools. To facilitate Uber issuing Customer Invoices, Merchant agrees to promptly notify Uber of any change of its VAT registration number and/or update to its VAT registration status.
    2. Where Merchant has completed the required Invoice Details and provided a valid VAT registration number, including on the relevant Uber Tools:
        1. Merchant authorises Uber to issue self-billed invoices in respect of any fees, bonuses, or other amounts charged by Merchant to Uber under or otherwise in relation to this agreement (“Self-billed Invoices”) for the Term;

* * 1. Merchant agrees to accept each self-billed invoice issued by Uber;
        2. Merchant agrees to promptly notify Uber of any change of its VAT registration number and/or update to its VAT registration status, including if it ceases to be VAT registered or transfers its business;
        3. Uber will be entitled to request periodic confirmation from Merchant as to the continuation of the mandate set forth in this clause 6(b), any changes as contemplated by clause 6(b)(iii) above, and/or any other details Uber may require.
    
    1. All Customer Invoices and Self-billed Invoices will be issued in PDF format only (unless otherwise required by Applicable Law) and will be accessible and downloadable by means of the relevant Uber Tools. No Customer Invoices and Self-billed Invoices will be issued or sent in paper format. Merchant agrees to store and archive the Customer Invoices and Self-billed Invoices in accordance with Applicable Law. Merchant hereby agrees not to issue any invoices for any amounts which form the subject of the Customer Invoices and Self-Billed Invoices referenced in this clause 6 (including sub-clauses) of these General Supplemental Terms. Merchant may dispute any Customer Invoices and Self-billed Invoice issued by Uber on Merchant's behalf within a period not exceeding seven (7) days from the issuance date of such invoice. Failing this, Merchant is deemed to have validated the relevant invoices in compliance with Applicable Laws. 

1. **Method Restrictions and Limitations.**
    1. Method Settings. If Merchant has selected both the Aggregator Method and the Marketplace Method, Merchant may select Aggregator Method and/or Marketplace Method for delivery of future orders of Items to its Customers. Merchant may apply its selections to some or all future orders. Merchant may modify its Method selection at any time. However, the selected Method for an order cannot be modified after the order has been placed. All orders pending at the time Merchant modifies its Method must be completed via the Method selected when the order was placed. The proper Method for each order will be reflected in Merchant’s order dashboard available via the Uber Tools. Uber may, at its discretion, modify delivery settings on Merchant’s behalf.
    2. Delivery Radius Modification. Uber, at its discretion, reserves the right to modify Merchant’s delivery radius for reasons including, without limitation, to prevent or otherwise limit unfulfilled orders.
    3. Temporary Usage Restriction. Uber, at its discretion, reserves the right to restrict or otherwise limit Merchant’s access to the Uber Eats App for a period of time for reasons including, without limitation, to prevent or otherwise limited unfulfilled orders
    4. Transfer Restrictions. The following restricted items may not be transferred via the Uber Eats App: people or animals of any size, illegal items, fragile items, dangerous items (like weapons, explosives, flammables, etc.), stolen goods, or any items that Merchant does not have permission to transfer. Uber Ireland reserves the right to prohibit transfer of additional Items at its sole discretion.
2. **Marks**.
    1. Marks. Subject to this Agreement, each party hereby grants to the other party (and, in the case of Uber, to its Affiliates) a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable license during the Term to use such party’s respective Marks, on a royalty free basis, in connection with the activities related to this Agreement. This license includes the right to reproduce, adapt and represent (in connection with all or part of the activities related to this Agreement) the Marks for the entire world, using all means and media, and without any restriction of any kind as regards exploitation methods, number of prints, dissemination or utilisation. All uses of a party’s Marks (owned or licensed, as applicable) by the other party will be in the form and format specified or approved by the party that owns (or is a licensee of, as applicable) such Marks. Other than as specifically set forth in this Agreement, neither party will use the other party’s Marks without the prior, express, written consent of the other party. Any use or display of Merchant’s Marks by Uber in connection with making Items available through the Uber Eats App in the ordinary course of business will not require any such prior, express, written consent. All goodwill related to the use of a party’s Marks by the other party will inure to the benefit of the party that owns (or is a licensee of, as applicable) such Marks. Except as expressly set forth herein, neither party will be deemed to grant the other party any license or rights under any intellectual property or other proprietary rights. All rights not granted are expressly reserved. Merchant agrees that it will not, and will ensure that Aggregator Couriers do not, try to register or otherwise use and/or claim ownership in any of the Uber Marks, alone or in combination with other letters, punctuation, words, symbols and/or designs, or in any confusingly similar mark, name or title, for any goods and services.
3. **Marketing and Promotional Activities**.
    1. Marketing. Uber may showcase the availability of Merchant’s Items via the Uber Eats App through various promotional activities including, without limitation, social media channels, websites, advertisements, blogs or other media available now or hereinafter created. Uber (or a party designated by Uber acting on Uber’s behalf) may create video, still images and/or other materials for marketing and other efforts related to the Uber Eats App ("Uber Eats Marketing Materials"). Merchant agrees that Uber Eats Marketing Materials (including, without limitation, all intellectual property rights therein) are and will remain the sole and exclusive property of Uber. Additionally, if Merchant Merchant Marketing Materials are used in connection with the display of Merchant’s Items on the Uber Eats App, Merchant hereby grants Uber a non-exclusive, royalty free right to use, reproduce, adapt, represent, and display such Merchant Marketing Materials in connection with Merchant’s Items and other promotional activities relating to the Uber Eats Services, for the entire world, during the Term, using all means and media, and without any restriction other than as required by Applicable Law as regards exploitation methods, number of prints, dissemination or utilisation.
    2. No Additional Amounts. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that, through advertising and marketing, Uber may seek to attract new merchants to Uber Eats and to increase existing users of the Uber Eats Services and Uber Eats App. Merchant acknowledges and agrees such advertising or marketing does not entitle Merchant to any additional monetary amounts beyond the amounts expressly stated in this Agreement.  
        
    3. Merchant Promotional Offers. Uber may authorize Merchant to use certain automated tools that allow Merchant to provide promotional Offers to Customers through the Uber Eats App in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Merchant agrees that it is solely responsible for fulfilling and, subject to technical and functional limitations of the automated tools, defining the Offers provided by Merchant to its Customers.
        1. Merchant Promotional Offers. Subject to this Agreement and any other guidelines or eligibility criteria for Offers that Uber may make available from time to time, Uber hereby authorizes Merchant to use Uber’s proprietary, automated tools ("Offer Tools") to create and provide Offers to Customers. Unless otherwise specified by Uber, Merchant will be solely responsible for defining each Offer (within the scope of functionality provided by the Offer Tools), including, without limitation, the start date, end date, and budget for each Offer. Each Offer will be subject to Uber’s prior written approval. Merchant is responsible for providing to Uber Offer Materials in a format and within deadlines specified by Uber for such to be reproduced for the provision of the Offer to Customers.
        2. Enhanced Promotional Placements. Subject to Uber Eats App functionality, Uber may provide enhanced promotional placement or other visual treatment for the Offers through the start and end date identified by Merchant. Merchant acknowledges that the time period of enhanced promotional placement for an Offer (if applicable) may vary due to a number of factors including Merchant’s budget, the start and end date for an Offer, and other Uber Eats App functionality.
        3. Merchant’s Responsibilities. Merchant will honor and fulfill the terms of the Offer. Merchant represents and warrants that Merchant will run all Offers in accordance with all Applicable Laws which apply to the Offers. Merchant represents and warrants that Merchant possesses all necessary authority, rights, licenses, consents and permissions to run the Offer (including, without limitation, the rights to any Offer Materials provided to Uber). Merchant will not use an Offer to make charitable donations. For free or reduced Delivery Charge Offers, Merchant will be solely responsible for the reduction to the amount that Uber collects from Customers with respect to the Delivery Charge.
        4. Reporting and Offer Costs. Uber will use good faith efforts to provide Merchant with reasonable information regarding Merchant's Offers, which may include, without limitation, the Offer Costs and the number of Items sold in connection with an Offer. Uber, in its sole discretion, may highlight Offers and/or the results of Offer in its own marketing materials.
        5. Service Fees. For Items where an Offer has been applied as a discount to the Retail Price of the Item, Uber Ireland will charge Merchant a Service Fee based on the discounted Retail Price and not the full Retail Price. If Merchant's Offer consists of a discount on delivery, the Service Fee will be calculated as described in the Agreement and will not change. Merchant agrees that Merchant is solely responsible for Offer Costs and that Uber Ireland may deduct Offer Costs from Merchant's Item Revenue. If Merchant is paid for an Item, it is responsible for the Service Fee and relevant Offer Costs.
        6. Modification, Suspension, Discontinuation. Uber reserves the right, at any time, temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, to modify, suspend or discontinue the Offer Tools or the ability for Merchant to provide Offers. Merchant agrees that neither Uber nor any of its Affiliates shall be liable to Merchant (or to any third party) for the Offer or the Offer Tools, including for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Offer or the Offer Tools or providing Merchant with the ability to provide Offers.  
            
    4. Ranking. We may use certain parameters to determine how prominently Merchants appear in the Uber Eats App (the “Parameters”). These Parameters are selected to optimise the marketplace experience for all users of the Uber Eats App, including you, Customers and Couriers. The main Parameters used for ranking include the time you have been on the Uber Eats App, customer preferences (evidenced, for example, by previous orders, searches or clicks), cuisine types, promotional offers, contextual factors (for example, the time of day, the day of the week), past ordering experiences (based, for example, on feedback, acceptance of orders and preparation time), availability, pricing, profitability (for Uber), basket size, estimated delivery time, delivery zone and any paid advertising you place on the Uber Eats App. The Parameters are taken into account any time merchants are displayed in the Uber Eats App, including in response to a Customer's search query and in the home feed. You can influence how prominently you appear in the Uber Eats App by making promotional offers, placing paid advertising, and receiving positive feedback from Customers and Couriers. Uber shall provide you with fifteen (15) days’ notice of important changes to the Parameters.
    5. Publicity. Except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement or otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, neither party may issue a press release or otherwise refer to the other party in any manner with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, without the prior written consent of such other party.
4. **Virtual Restaurants.**
    1. Definition. A Merchant who currently offers Meals via the Uber Eats App may, under certain conditions, operate a Virtual Restaurant. All Virtual Restaurant Meals are sold by Merchant.

Merchant represents and warrants that (A) the Virtual Restaurant trading name does not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third party’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights and (B) it has the right to display the Virtual Restaurant trading name on the Uber Eats App. Merchant agrees that Uber may remove Virtual Restaurant from the Uber Eats App if Uber reasonably believes that it may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any intellectual property or other proprietary rights.
        4. Uber may provide Merchant with Virtual Restaurant Data. Merchant agrees that any Virtual Restaurant Data provided by Uber or its Affiliates to Merchant constitutes Confidential Information.
5. **Confidential Information; Personal Data; Feedback.**
    1. Definition. Each Recipient agrees that it will not disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information to any third parties other than Representatives, or use it in any way other than as necessary to perform this Agreement.

The foregoing prohibition on use and disclosure of Confidential Information will not apply to the extent: (i) the Discloser has authorized such use or disclosure (and Merchant hereby authorizes Uber to disclose the terms of this Agreement to Merchant’s franchisees in connection with executing contracts that reference this Agreement with such franchisees) and (ii) a Recipient is required to disclose certain Confidential Information of the Discloser as a matter of law or by order of a court, provided that the Recipient gives the Discloser prior written notice of such obligation to disclose (to the extent legally permissible) and reasonably assist in obtaining a protective order prior to making such disclosure. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement and as requested by Discloser, each Recipient will deliver to the Discloser (or destroy at the Discloser’s election) any and all materials or documents containing the Discloser’s Confidential Information, together with all copies thereof in whatever form. Neither party makes any representation or warranty that Confidential Information is complete or accurate; all Confidential Information is provided "as is".
    2. Privacy. Merchant agrees to use Personal Data provided to Merchant by Uber solely for the purpose of providing Items to Customers under this Agreement. Merchant agrees to use Personal Data provided to Merchant by Uber solely by using the Uber Tools provided by Uber and shall not copy, store, retain, remove from the Uber Tools or otherwise process the Personal Data. Only in the Aggregator Method, Merchant is permitted to copy Personal Data provided via the Uber Tools and share it with its Aggregator Couriers for the sole purpose of providing Items to Customers in accordance with this Agreement, and will be responsible for compliance with applicable data protection regulations as a data controller, or the responsible party, for such Personal Data as specified in clause 5(a) of the Aggregator Method Specific Supplemental Terms. In respect of any Personal Data transferred by Uber to Merchant, the parties agree that they shall enter into the Data Processing Agreement (controller to controller) in substantially the form attached hereto, included as part of the Aggregator Method Specific Supplemental Terms.
    3. Aggregate Data. Merchant acknowledges that Uber may use aggregate, anonymized data related to Merchant’s transactions in connection with the Uber Eats Services ("Aggregate Data") and may share Aggregate Data with a commercial partner to achieve any commercial purpose, as described in paragraph (h) below.

    4. Third Party Disclosure. Merchant acknowledges that Uber may share Merchant contact information (including name, address, email, and phone number) with third parties necessary to Merchant's onboarding on the Uber Eats App, including logistics and/or delivery service providers (for the delivery of Devices or other equipment), as well as photography services (for any photography which may be provided by a third-party provider on behalf of Uber).

However, to the extent that Merchant provides or otherwise makes available Feedback to Uber, Merchant hereby grants to Uber a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty free, fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, adapt, represent and otherwise exploit such Feedback, during the Term, using all means and media, and without any restriction of any kind with regard to exploitation methods, number of prints, dissemination or utilisation.
    8. Access to Uber Data. The Uber Data you have access to through your use of the Uber Eats Services and Uber Tools, includes onboarding data (e.g. bank account information, contact information, KYC information), operational data (e.g. order history, delivery information and other metrics), financial data (e.g. Item Revenue due to you, Fees due to Uber, past payout amounts), and feedback (from Customers and Couriers). After expiry or termination of this Agreement, you will lose access to Uber Data. Uber has access to Uber Data via the Uber Tools and may use it for the purposes described in Uber’s Privacy Notice and for commercial purposes, unless expressly prohibited by this Agreement. Uber may share data with third parties as described in its Privacy Notice (available at privacy.uber.com), for example with service providers that assist Uber in providing the Uber Eats Services, and it is not possible for Merchant to opt-out of such sharing. Uber may also share Aggregate Data with selected partners for commercial purposes related to the Uber Eats App (“Partner Sharing”). It is not possible for Merchant to opt-out of Partner Sharing, however Merchant’s data is not individually identifiable within Aggregate Data. In case Uber Data is also considered, in accordance with applicable laws, Merchant’s Personal Data, the information provided in, and the rights afforded under, Uber’s privacy notice shall, in case of a conflict, supersede this paragraph. 
6. **Indemnification**.
    1. Indemnified Claims. Each party (the "Indemnifying Party") will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, causes of action, and losses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) (collectively, "Losses") with respect to any third party claim arising out of or related to: (i) the negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party or its employees or agents (in Merchant’s case, including Aggregator Couriers but excluding Uber and Marketplace Couriers to the extent they are Merchant’s agents) in their performance of this Agreement; (ii) any claims that, if true, would be a breach of any of the Indemnifying Party’s (in Merchant’s case, including via Aggregator Couriers) representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement; and (iii) any claims that the Indemnifying Party’s Marks infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, as long as such Marks have been used in the manner approved by the Indemnifying Party.
    2. Merchant will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Uber Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses with respect to any third party claim arising out of or related to: (A) Merchant’s violation or alleged violation of any applicable retail food or other health and safety code, rule or regulation, (B) Merchant’s failure to determine the applicable VAT and other fees charged; (C) Merchant’s failure to apply correct VAT rates, including those rates adjusted by Uber on Merchant’s behalf; (D) VAT, other fees, penalties, interest and other costs related to Merchant’s obligations; (E) Merchant copying, storing, retaining, removing from the Uber Tools or otherwise processing the Personal Data, except as permitted by clause 11(b) of these General Supplemental Terms; (F) any third party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a third party’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights arising out of or in connection with any: (i) Merchant Marketing Materials; and/or (ii) Offer run by Merchant and use of Offer Materials; and/or (G) any third party claim arising out of or in connection with the manufacture, production, distribution, handling, advertising, consumption or use of, or otherwise relating to, any Offer run by Merchant, whether or not any claim arises during the Term of the Agreement, except in the case of each of (A)-(E) above, to the extent such harm was directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Uber or its employees, agents or Couriers. With respect to the indemnities in (F) and (G) above, approval by an Uber Party of any Offer or use of any Offer Materials shall not affect this right of indemnification.
    3. Procedure. Each Indemnified Party will provide prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party of any potential claim subject to indemnification hereunder. The Indemnifying Party will assume the defence of the claim through counsel designated by it and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will not settle or compromise any claim, or consent to the entry of any judgment, without written consent of the Indemnified Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defence of a claim, at Indemnifying Party’s expense.

Merchant shall not cancel or materially reduce its insurance without thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Uber. Upon a party’s request, the other party will provide evidence of the insurance required herein.

4. **General**.
    1. Waiver. The failure of either party to enforce, at any time or for any period of time, the provisions hereof, or the failure of either party to exercise any option herein, shall not be construed as a waiver of such provision or option and shall in no way affect that party’s right to enforce such provisions or exercise such option.

In that event, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable (part of the) provision with a (part of a) provision that is legal, valid and enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the illegal, invalid or unenforceable (part of the) provision, given the contents and purpose of the Agreement.

**5\. Payment services provided by Uber Payments on behalf of Uber**

5.1 Uber Payments enables the Partner to receive payments from the User or another Partner for Services that the Partner provides through an Uber Platform. The Partner therefore agrees that Uber Payments will accept and process payment transactions, including E-money transactions. More specifically, Uber Payments receives any funds due by the User or another Partner (the Partner Charges) or Uber (the Uber Amounts) on behalf of the Partner. Upon receiving the funds, Uber Payments deducts any applicable Fees and pays out the remainder to the Partner (the Pay-out Amount) as set-out in Article 7.

5.2 Uber Payments administers the Pay-out Amount in the name of the Partner. Uber Payments will only transfer the Pay-out Amount to a Partner (Pay-out) if it has received the full amount (including Fees) from a User or another Partner or another payment service provider (and in the event of an Uber Amount, from Uber) for the Services and if such transfer is in accordance with the Agreement and the Payments Terms.

**6\. Partner Charges and P2P Charges**

  
6.1 On behalf of Uber, Uber Payments will collect the Partner Charges due to the Partner for the Services provided. Any such Partner Charges will be received by the Custodian or, if received by Uber Payments, be transferred to the Custodian as soon as possible. Uber Payments will on behalf of Uber subsequently arrange for Pay-out of the Pay-out Amount to the Partner in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.  
  
6.2 Uber Payments will transfer the P2P Charge for the provided Services on behalf of the Partner that owes the P2P Charge to the Partner to which the P2P Charge is due (for which latter Partner Uber Payments receives the P2P Charge as a Partner Charge).

6.3 Uber Payments will transfer the Pay-out Amount to the Partner in the currency in which the Partner Charge was received by the Custodian.  
  
6.4 Uber Payments will arrange for Pay-out to the bank account as designated by the Partner on the relevant Uber Platform. The Partner may only designate a bank account that is administered in its own name for Pay-out. Any changes of the bank account must be notified to Uber Payments as soon as possible. The Partner represents and warrants that the bank account designated by it on the Uber Platform is a bank account administered in its own name.  
  
6.5 The Partner authorizes Uber Payments to use the Partner Charges (including for the avoidance of doubt, the P2P Charge) to satisfy all claims of Uber or third parties vis-à-vis the Partner under or pursuant to the Agreement and/or the Payments Terms. Uber Payments is authorized to deduct the amount of such claims from the Partner Charges and transfer such amounts to Uber and itself. Uber Payments shall in this respect be entitled to solely rely on the information it receives from Uber as binding evidence of such amounts due by the Partner. The Partner may provide evidence to the contrary.

**7. Pay-out**

7.1 Uber, Uber Payments and the Partner can agree that Pay-out takes place on a specific incidental or recurring date. Such agreement constitutes an instruction for Pay-out. Such instruction for Pay-out will be regarded as having been received by Uber Payments on the moment that the Partner indicates on the relevant Uber Platform that it wishes to receive Pay-out and the agreement to that instruction has been confirmed by Uber on its behalf and on behalf of Uber Payments.  
  
7.2 Any instruction for Pay-out received by (or on behalf of) Uber Payments (a) on a day that is not a Business Day or (b) after 17:00 Amsterdam time on a Business Day will be regarded as having been received on the next Business Day.  
  
7.3 If Pay-out takes place in euros, Uber Payments will ensure that the account of the bank holding such account is credited with the Pay-out amount no later than on the end of the first Business Day immediately following the receipt of the instruction for Pay-out in accordance with these Payments Terms.  
  
7.4 If Pay-out takes place in a currency of an EEA country, but other than euros, Uber Payments will ensure that the account of the bank holding such account is credited with the Pay-out amount no later than the end of the fourth Business Day following the receipt of the instruction for Pay-out in accordance with these Payments Terms.

**8\. Refusal and limitations on Pay-out**

8.1 Uber Payments may at any time (at its own discretion) decide not to pay-out any Pay-out Amount to a Partner if:

* an attachment has been levied under Uber Payments and/or the Custodian in respect of the Partner;
* Transferring such an amount would conflict with the law or other applicable national or international regulations, relevant guidance or instructions from a competent regulator or a binding judicial order or verdict;

8.4 Uber Payments may limit or temporarily or permanently suspend a Partner's access to the Payment Services (i) to comply with applicable law, or the order or request of a court, law enforcement, a regulator or other administrative agency or governmental body, or if (ii) a Partner has breached the Payments Terms, the Agreement, applicable laws, regulations or third-party rights, (iii) a Partner has provided inaccurate, fraudulent, outdated, or incomplete information under the Payments Terms or the Agreement, or (iv) Uber Payments believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety or property of Uber, Uber Payments, the Custodian, Users, other Partners, or third parties, or to prevent fraud or other illegal activity.  
  
8.5 Partners are responsible for compliance with any and all laws, rules, regulations, and tax obligations that may apply to the use of the Payment Services.

9.2 If Uber Payments processes a Pay-out on the basis of the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) (or other unique identifier) provided by the Partner, Uber Payments is deemed to have correctly processed the Pay-out. Uber Payments is not obliged vis-à-vis the Partner to check whether the IBAN given to Uber Payments is correct and whether the name and IBAN of the account holder to which the Pay-out is made correspond.  
  
9.3 Uber Payments will not be liable for Pay-outs if the Partner provides an incorrect IBAN. The Partner may request Uber Payments to assist in retrieving the amount transferred to an incorrect IBAN provided by the Partner, in which case Uber Payments will undertake reasonable efforts to assist the Partner, including providing the Partner with relevant information in Uber Payments' possession that the Partner needs for reclaiming the amounts paid. Fees may be charged for this assistance.

**13. Indemnification**

The Partner shall indemnify, defend (at Uber’s option) and hold harmless Uber, Uber Payments, the Custodian and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all liabilities, expenses (including legal fees), damages, penalties, fines, social security contributions and taxes arising out of or related to: (a) Partner's breach of its representations, warranties or obligations under the Payments Terms; or (b) a claim by a third party (including Users, regulators and governmental authorities) directly or indirectly related to Partner's provision of Services.

15.2 Additional terms and conditions may apply to the Payment Services. The Partner may, if applicable, be offered these additional terms and conditions.

In the event of conflict, the additional terms prevail over these Payments Terms.  

**16\. Miscellaneous Terms**

  
16.1 If any (part of a) provision of these Payments Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

In consideration for the Uber Eats Services in connection with the Marketplace Method, Uber Ireland will charge Merchant a Marketplace Service Fee in the amount set out in the Order Form for each Marketplace Item sold by Merchant via the Uber Eats App. Uber Ireland will calculate the Marketplace Service Fee as follows: the Retail Price of the Item(s) sold by Merchant via the Uber Eats App (including any VAT or other sales tax) (the "Marketplace Item Payment") multiplied by the Marketplace Service Fee percentage. The Marketplace Service Fee shall be deemed to be exclusive of VAT).
    2. Marketplace Cash Orders. Uber Ireland may facilitate a delivery option to Customers in the Territory that allows them to pay for a given Marketplace Item provided by Merchant and all associated fees and charges resulting from that transaction in cash (a "Marketplace Cash Order").
    3. Collections.

The Marketplace Courier shall be notified of the funds to be collected by the Marketplace Courier ("Marketplace Cash Collections"), exclusive of any gratuities, in the Uber Eats App. Uber’s and/or its Affiliates' role as Merchant’s agent with regard to Marketplace Cash Collections shall be to collect the Marketplace Item Payment and Uber Ireland’s Marketplace Service Fee from Marketplace Couriers by either obtaining the funds electronically or offsetting such amounts from funds otherwise due to Marketplace Couriers from their delivery services in aggregate generated on the Uber Eats App. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that collection shall be the responsibility of the Marketplace Courier. If for whatever reason Marketplace Courier’s electronic payment to Uber and/or its Affiliates is delayed or unsuccessful, Uber and/or its Affiliates, in its capacity as Merchant’s collection agent, will act as a fall-back and ensure receipt of payment by Merchant. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that in consideration of Uber Ireland’s provision of lead generation, demand prediction, and other related services provided via the Uber Eats App under the Agreement, Merchant owes Uber Ireland the respective Marketplace Service Fee, regardless of collections related to the attempted or completed deliveries.

    3. Aggregator Cash Deliveries. Uber may facilitate a delivery option to Customers that allows them to pay for a given Aggregator Item provided by Merchant and all associated fees and charges resulting from that transaction in cash (an "Aggregator Cash Order").

    5. No Additional Amounts.

With regard to cash gratuities provided by a Customer directly to an Aggregator Courier, no portion of that gratuity is owed to or should be paid to Uber.
3. **Aggregator Delivery Terms**.
    1. Provision of Delivery Services.

    3. Merchant’s Relationship with Uber.

Uber does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control Merchant or its Aggregator Couriers generally or in its or their performance under this Agreement specifically, including in connection with the operation of its business, the provision of delivery services, the acts or omissions of Aggregator Couriers, or the operation and maintenance of any Transportation Method.

**Uber Eats Sponsored Listing Terms**
=====================================

The following Specific Supplemental Terms (“Sponsored Listing Terms”) govern your ability to use Ads Manager to create Campaign(s) and submit Bid(s) for the opportunity to obtain a Sponsored Listing (as defined below) on the Uber Eats App. All undefined, capitalized terms will have the meaning set forth in the Order Form, the Definitions or the General Supplemental Terms. In the event of any conflict between these Sponsored Listing Terms and the Order Form, the Definitions or the General Supplemental Terms, these Sponsored Listing Terms shall govern as applied to the subject matter herein.

By submitting a Bid you are accepting and agree to be bound by these Sponsored Listing Terms at all times when using the Ads Manager to create Campaigns, submit Bids and in with respect to all Sponsored Listings and Sponsored Listing Fees.

### **1\. Definitions.**

In these Sponsored Listing Terms, the following terms have the respective meanings given to them below:

**“Ads Manager”** means Uber’s proprietary, automated, self-service tool located within the Uber Tools, used to create Bids;

**“Bid”** means an offer by you for a Sponsored Listing, subject to your Campaign Budget constraints;

"**Brand Matter**" means an event that, in Uber’s reasonable judgement, would jeopardise the ability of the Merchant to comply with or perform the Merchant Agreement or these Sponsored Listing Terms, or prejudice the goodwill or reputation of Uber or its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, matters related to the alleged violation of the Community Guidelines or any Applicable Laws.

“**Campaign**” means a sustained period of time for which you agree in advance to make Bids;

“**Campaign Period**” means the length of time for which your Sponsored Listing appears;

“**Campaign Budget**” means the amount authorised by you to spend on Sponsored Listing Fees;

“**Sponsored Listing**” means a placement on the Uber Eats App which: (a) subject to Uber’s discretion, will include some indicator to customers that the placement was purchased by you, such as a tag such as “promoted” or “sponsored”; (b) will appear in the Uber Eats App (and may appear on the Uber Eats website) in a placement determined by Uber, or otherwise selected by you in your Bid submission; and (c) will be assembled and formatted based on the content provided in accordance with your Merchant Agreement.

“**Sponsored Listing Fee**” means an amount based on the actual number of clicks on your Sponsored Listing at the rate determined by Uber for each placement;

**“Uber Ads Representative”** means an Uber representative who you authorise to make the changes described in these Sponsored Listing Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, any Uber representative whom you instruct to make these changes shall be deemed authorised;

### **2\. Sponsored Listings.**

Subject to these Sponsored Listing Terms, Uber authorises Merchant to submit Bids. A detailed explanation of how Sponsored Listings work, including information on placement, and the auction and selection process, can be found at https://restaurants.ubereats.com/sponsored-listings/. A selected Sponsored Listing will be placed on the Uber Eats App. For clarity, a Sponsored Listing may be posted anytime after it is selected and will continue to appear until the Campaign Budget is exhausted, until Uber removes it for any reason permitted by these Sponsored Listing Terms, or until you end the campaign in accordance with Section 6.

### **3\. Creating Campaigns.**

When you use the Ads Manager or instruct an Uber Ads Representative to create a Bid on your behalf, you authorise Uber to assemble and format Sponsored Listings based on the content provided in accordance with your Merchant Agreement. Uber may, in its sole discretion, limit access to the Ads Manager, restrict the merchants or categories of merchants who can create Sponsored Listings, limit the number of Sponsored Listings you can create at a given time, and limit the availability of any or all of the Sponsored Listings (for example, to listings from certain categories or containing certain attributes). By placing a Bid, you acknowledge that you may or may not obtain a Sponsored Listing. You acknowledge that each Bid submitted is placed in an auction; submission of a Bid does not guarantee a Sponsored Listing.

**_a._** **_Uber created Bids._** If you have an Uber Ads Representative, and have agreed in writing that such Uber Ads Representative may place Bids on your behalf, you agree to provide authorisation in advance to such representatives before any Bids are placed, indicating that you wish to create Sponsored Listings, your weekly budget for each Merchant location, and any other supported criteria.

**_b. Self-Serve Ads Manager._** You agree to only use and access such Ads Manager within its functionality and technical capability, recognise that such tool is proprietary to Uber and will not circumvent or otherwise exploit the tool in such a way that is not intended. For clarity, the rights and obligations in the Merchant Agreement relating to Uber Tools shall apply to Ads Manager.

**_c. Authorisation of Spending._** Upon submission of a Bid, you agree that you will be obligated to spend up to your authorised Campaign Budget amount if your Bid is selected. Uber will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure your Campaign Budget is not exceeded.

**_d. Content for Sponsored Listings._** The content included in the Sponsored Listing will be the Merchant Marketing Materials provided under the Merchant Agreement, or other videos, still images or materials provided by Merchant to Uber and used in connection with the display of Merchant’s Items on the Uber Eats App (“**Merchant Material**”). You are responsible for ensuring that the Merchant Material complies with all Applicable Laws and applicable advertising codes and guidance. Uber reserves the right to remove any Sponsored Listing if it reasonably believes the Merchant Material breaches the terms of the Merchant Agreement or may cause a Brand Matter. Uber will determine the size, placement, and positioning of your Sponsored Listings and you acknowledge that any Sponsored Listings shown in preview or surfaced prior may be changed in Uber’s sole discretion.

### **4\. Your Responsibilities.**

You will be solely responsible for the payment of the Sponsored Listing Fees, whether such Bid was submitted by you or another Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merchant Agreement, in the event of a termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms in accordance with Section 7 or the end of a Campaign, you agree that you will be obligated to pay the Sponsored Listing Fees up until the end of the Campaign or the effective date of termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms. You agree to limit access to Ads Manager to validated and authorised Representatives or anyone else acting on your behalf. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your Representatives and their actions in connection with their use of Ads Manager. You will ensure that your Representatives comply with all restrictions applicable to you under these Sponsored Listing Terms and all applicable third-party rights, laws, rules and regulations.

### **5\. Uber Responsibilities.**

Uber will provide you with reasonable information, no later than the end of the month in which the Sponsored Listing appears, regarding your Sponsored Listing(s), which will include your Sponsored Listing Fees, associated performance metrics and any other information required by Applicable Laws. Subject to the functionality of the Ads Manager, Uber may, in its sole discretion, provide enhanced promotional placement or other visual treatment for the Sponsored Listings. Merchant acknowledges that the time period of the Sponsored Listing may vary due to a number of factors including Merchant’s Campaign Budget as authorised in an applicable Bid, parameters set by Uber in our sole discretion and the Ads Manager functionality.

### **6\. Fees.**

Sponsored Listing Fees are exclusive of any VAT or other sales taxes. If applicable, VAT and/or other sales taxes shall be charged and collected in the same manner as Sponsored Listing Fees. Uber may charge different rates for different placements of a Sponsored Listing upon notice to you. For clarity, you won’t be charged a fee for access to the Ads Manager or for placing a Sponsored Listing via an Uber Ads Representative.

**_a. Invoicing and Payment Schedule._**

Uber will charge the Sponsored Listing Fees to you. You agree that unless otherwise agreed in writing, Uber or its affiliates will deduct the Sponsored Listing Fees from any payment due to you, such as a deduction from the remittance of Item Revenue collected on each Merchant’s behalf. Further, we may continue to deduct such Sponsored Listing Fees from following weekly payouts until such time when the Sponsored Listing Fees are paid in full. If agreed by Uber in writing, Uber may invoice you in arrears for the amount of the Sponsored Listing Fees, which shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days of your receipt of such invoice. In both instances, collection of the Sponsored Listing Fee will take place after placement of a Sponsored Listing. Subject to the foregoing, Uber reserves the right to set a maximum spend threshold or suspend your access to the Ads Manager until the Sponsored Listing Fees are paid in full. Uber reserves the right to offer credits and/or discounts to fully or partially fund the Sponsored Listing Fees, which may be subject to a limited time period or other restrictions, at Uber’s sole discretion. Uber and affiliates further reserve the right to collect Sponsored Listing Fees by debiting the payment method or your bank account on record, or otherwise seeking reimbursement from you by any lawful collection methods available. Any disputes about Sponsored Listing Fees must be submitted to Uber in writing within 14 days of the date you incurred such charge, otherwise you waive such dispute and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.

**_b. Charged per Click._** 

Based on the budget defined in your Bid submission, Uber will calculate your Sponsored Listing Fees based on the price per click. Sponsored Listing Fees are determined at the rate in effect for a particular Sponsored Listing at the time it is clicked. You understand that third parties may generate impressions or clicks on your Sponsored Listing for unintended purposes and you acknowledge and agree that you may still be charged for such clicks. See https://restaurants.ubereats.com/sponsored-listings/ for more information on the auction and bidding process.

### **7\. Termination.**

You may cancel a Bid at any time, provided, however, that your Sponsored Listing(s) may run up to 3 business days after such cancellation. You will be responsible for the Sponsored Listing Fees until the Bid is cancelled. Upon cancellation, these Sponsored Listing Terms shall automatically terminate, provided, however, termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms will not result in termination of the Agreement unless the party terminating these Sponsored Listing Terms also terminates the Agreement in accordance with its terms. Termination of the Agreement will automatically result in termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms or the Agreement will not relieve either party of its pre-existing obligations hereunder.

### **8\. Data.**

Uber shall grant you a limited, exclusive, revocable, license to certain data for free and aggregated reporting related to such Sponsored Listings. Such license shall expire upon termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms or any superseding terms. You will undertake reasonable commercial and technological efforts to prevent unauthorised access or copying of such data by third parties and you will protect, and prevent, such aggregated and anonymised data from being attributed to individual users of the Uber Tools by yourself or third parties. You agree that Uber may share Uber Data with third-party service providers for the purposes of providing Sponsored Listings. In case Uber Data is also considered Merchant’s Personal Data in accordance with Applicable Laws, the information provided in, and the rights afforded under, Uber’s privacy notice shall supersede this paragraph in case of a conflict.

### **9\. Feedback.**

You understand and acknowledge that the form and function of the Ads Manager may change at any time in Uber’s sole discretion. You understand and agree that you may voluntarily provide and/or submit to Uber Feedback, during the Sponsored Listing, and the terms of the Merchant Agreement shall apply to such Feedback.

### **10\. Testing.**

You authorise Uber to periodically conduct non-material tests that may affect your access to or use of the Ads Manager, as well as your ability to surface Sponsored Listings. These tests may include, but are not limited to, changes in formatting, or placement of Sponsored Listings. Uber will provide you with at least 15 days’ notice of any testing which may have a material impact on the performance of your Sponsored Listing. In any case, you shall only pay on a per click basis for your Sponsored Listing (as described in Section 5(a) above).

### **11\. Confidentiality.**

For the avoidance of doubt, all elements, including any design features and components offered and displayed (whether orally, visually, or in writing) of the Uber Eats Sponsored Listing program, including the existence and structure of the Uber Eats Sponsored Listing program, are confidential and should be handled in accordance with the confidentiality obligations in the Merchant Agreement.

### **12\. Disclaimer.**

Except for the express warranties stated herein, neither party makes, and each party expressly disclaims, all representations and warranties, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the subject matter of these Sponsored Listing Terms. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Uber makes no representation or warranty as to the benefit that Merchant will obtain from the Sponsored Listings. Moreover, Uber does not represent or warrant that the Ads Manager will be error-free, always available or operate without loss or corruption of data or technical malfunction.

### **13\. Other.**

These Sponsored Listing Terms may be superseded and replaced by subsequent terms and conditions located at: [https://www.uber.com/legal/en/](https://www.uber.com/legal/en/) or in the Ads Manager, upon 15 days’ written or electronic notice by Uber. By continuing to submit Bids after the notice period, you agree to be bound by any subsequent terms and conditions relating to the activities described in these Sponsored Listing Terms. Uber reserves the right, at any time, temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, to modify, suspend or discontinue the Ads Manager or the ability for Merchant to place Bids, with or without notice. You agree that neither Uber nor any of its affiliates shall be liable to you (or to any third party) for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Ads Manager or providing you with the ability to place Bids. Each party acknowledges that the arrangements contemplated hereby are non-exclusive and nothing herein shall be deemed to restrict or limit Uber's ability to engage in similar relationships, agreements or arrangements with any other party. Except as specifically amended by these Sponsored Listing Terms, the terms and conditions of the Merchant Agreement and any amendments thereto shall remain in full force and effect.

### **Uber Promotion Tools Terms and Conditions**

Merchant acknowledges that the time period of enhanced promotional placement for an Offer may be subject to a number of factors, including but not limited to Merchant’s budget for such Offer, the start and end date for an Offer identified by Merchant, and Uber Eats App functionality.

#### **2\. Your Responsibilities.**

Merchant is the promoter of each Offer. You are solely responsible for fulfilling the terms of each Offer provided by you to your customers, and you are likewise solely responsible for providing and enforcing terms, conditions, or other rules for your customers governing each Offer. You represent and warrant that you will run your Offers in accordance with all Applicable Laws and that you have all necessary authority, rights, licenses, consents and permissions to run your Offers (including, without limitation, the rights to provide the Offer Materials to Uber). You will not use the Offers to make charitable donations. When providing any Offer (and using the Offer Tools), you agree that you are subject to any additional guidelines, rules, and terms and conditions posted by Uber, which are hereby incorporated by reference into these Promotion Terms.

#### **3\. Reporting and Offer Costs.**

Uber will use good faith efforts to provide you with reasonable information regarding your Offers, which may include, without limitation, the amount you have spent on each Offer (“Offer Costs”) and the number of Items sold in connection with each Offer. Uber, in its sole discretion, may highlight Offers and/or the results of Offers in Uber Eats Marketing Materials.

#### **4\. Fees.**

In consideration for Merchant’s efforts in running an Offer and stimulating customer demand and user traction through the Uber Eats App, Merchant shall charge Uber a promotional services fee (the “Promotional Fee”) in the amount separately agreed upon for the relevant Offer.

For Items where an Offer has been applied as a discount to the Retail Price of the Item, Uber will charge you a Service Fee based on the sum of the discounted Retail Price and the Promotional Fee. If the Offer consists of a discount on the Marketplace or Aggregator Delivery Charge, the Service Fee will be calculated as described in your Agreement and will not change. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for Offer Costs and that Uber may deduct Offer Costs from your Item Revenue.

#### **5\. Self-billing.**

You hereby grant a mandate to Uber to issue invoices/credit notes to itself for any Promotional Fees charged by you under this agreement (“Self-billed Invoices”). Uber hereby accepts the mandate granted by you, provided that you have completed your invoice settings on Restaurant Manager and have provided all information required for the accurate calculation and preparation of the Self-billed Invoices. All Self-billed Invoices will be issued in PDF format only (unless otherwise required by Applicable Law) and can be accessed and downloaded from Restaurant Manager.

You agree to keep your invoice settings up to date and agree to notify Uber immediately if you change your VAT registration number and/or update your VAT registration status.

You may dispute any Self-billed Invoice issued by Uber within a period not exceeding seven (7) days from the issuance date of such Self-billed Invoice. If no such dispute is raised during this seven day period, you are deemed to have validated the relevant Self-billed Invoice.

You hereby agree not to issue any other invoices for the Promotional Fee set out in this agreement.

#### **6\. Indemnity.**

Merchant shall indemnify Uber, its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the “Uber Parties”) against all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses (including but not limited to any interest, penalties and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis and all other professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by the Uber Parties arising out of or in connection with: (a) any third party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a third party’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights arising out of or in connection with any Offer run by the Merchant and use of the Offer Materials; and (b) any third party claim arising out of or in connection with the manufacture, production, distribution, handling, advertising, consumption or use of, or otherwise relating to, any Offer run by the Merchant, whether or not any claim arises during the Term of the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any approval by an Uber Party of any Offer or use of Offer Materials shall not affect this right of indemnification.

#### **7\. Other.**

Uber may amend these Promotion Terms from time to time in its sole discretion, and such amendments will be effective thirty (30) days after Uber’s posting of an updated Promotion Terms at [www.uber.com](http://www.uber.com/) or such updated Promotion Terms otherwise being made available to Merchant by Uber, including, for example, through Restaurant Manager. Merchant’s continued use of the Offer Tools after such updated Promotion Terms become effective constitutes Merchant’s consent to be bound by the updated Promotion Terms. Merchant has the right to terminate the Promotion Terms in the event that Merchant disagrees with the amendments made in any updated Promotion Terms. Uber reserves the right, at any time, temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, to modify, suspend or discontinue the Offer Tools or the ability for Merchant to provide Offers, with or without notice. You agree that neither Uber nor any of its affiliates shall be liable to you (or to any third party) for the Offer or the Offer Tools, including for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Offer or the Offer Tools or providing Merchant with the ability to provide Offers.
