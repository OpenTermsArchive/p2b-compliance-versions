The Huawei Brand Protection Agreement (hereinafter, this "Agreement") is entered into by and between you and Huawei. This Agreement forms an integral part of the HUAWEI Developers Service Agreement and together with the HUAWEI Developers Service Agreement, it governs your use of any Huawei Brand.

1. In this Agreement, **"Huawei Brand"** means any and all trademarks, trade names, service marks, slogans, designs, distinctive advertising, labels, logos, and other trade-identifying symbols (or any of the foregoing and other works in which copyright subsists or is capable of subsisting) that have been developed and/or used by Huawei, anywhere in the world, and irrespective of whether or not the rights which subsist in them have been registered by Huawei.
2. In using any Huawei Brand, you shall not infringe upon or seek to infringe upon any rights of portrait, rights of name, and other personality rights owned by any Huawei employees and personnel connected to Huawei employees. Without prior written consent by Huawei, you may not use content containing portraits/images or names of Huawei employees (especially Huawei executives), spokespersons for Huawei products, and personnel connected to Huawei employees in external commercial activities.
3. You shall ensure that any and all content you publish is authentic and legitimate and that you have the rights and permissions required for publication. You may not publish any false or misleading content. You may only use promotion keywords with Huawei's prior written consent and in accordance with the Brand Guidelines, and under no circumstance may your use of promotion keywords infringe upon any third-party rights. You shall not remove, cover, or alter any instances of the Huawei Brand, numbers, ownership statements, copyright notices, labels, or other identifiable marks on Huawei Products, or attach or use any third-party trademarks or logos on Huawei Products. In addition, you shall not make any modifications or alterations to the packaging or products bearing the Huawei Brand in any way.
4. You shall not use the Huawei Brand for any illegal purposes, or purposes not contemplated by any Huawei agreements which you are bound by, nor use the Huawei Brand beyond the authorized scope, including but not limited to:
    
    (a) on products or services that are not related to Huawei;
    
    (b) beyond the authorized scenarios, such as in/on your office space, shop signs, product manuals, letters and emails, product packaging, and work clothes; or
    
    (c) without Huawei's consent (1) as search keywords; (2) for setting up a competitive ranking; (3) as parts of any domain name or URL.
    
    Before you use the Huawei Brand, you must submit a written application to Huawei and obtain Huawei's express approval.
    
5. In the case of joint brand marketing, when you use the Huawei Brand in goods or services with legitimate authorization, your use shall be appropriate to the type of cooperation you are engaged in with Huawei and you shall accurately indicate the nature of the cooperation. If you use the Huawei Brand with your trademarks or those of third parties, you shall obtain Huawei's prior written consent in written form and as far as possible, present the Huawei Brand in a manner that it cannot be confused with your or a third party's trademark.
6. You shall not use the Huawei Brand for media advertisements, signage advertisements, publicity materials, or other naming or similar channels unless you request and obtain Huawei's prior written consent and if given such consent, you shall adhere to any and all Huawei guidelines, policies, and instructions given to you. If Huawei determines that the Huawei Brand in any description of your products and/or services used in your advertising and marketing is not within the authorized scope of any permission granted, or contains misleading content, or does not accord with Huawei guidelines, policies, or instructions given to you, you shall immediately remove such content upon receiving a written request from Huawei.
7. You shall not, without obtaining Huawei's prior written consent, apply for registration of any commercial marks anywhere in the world in respect of: (1) the Huawei Brand; (2) any trademark, trade name or company name, social media account, domain name, graphic, design, symbol or word order, or work in which copyright subsists, that contains, in whole or in part, the Huawei Brand; or (3) any of the properties listed in (2) which are similar to, or potentially confusing with any Huawei Brand or the ongoing trademark application owned by other third-party licensor. Huawei may at its sole discretion decide whether your trademark application constitutes a similar trademark or not. If you have previously applied for registration of the aforementioned trademarks, Huawei may require that you, at Huawei's discretion, without delay and at your own expense, do any or all of the following: (a) assign the registered trademarks to Huawei, (b) withdraw or cancel the trademark application(s), and/or (c) invoke any other lawful procedures, with Huawei's prior written consent, that have the effect of transferring or extinguishing trademark rights and properly securing Huawei's registered rights and protecting the Huawei Brand.
8. You shall immediately notify Huawei and provide a detailed explanation in written form, and shall not take any further action without Huawei's prior written consent if:
    
    (a) the trademarks, names, logos, designs, patterns, or symbols used by third parties might constitute an infringement of the Huawei Brand;
    
    (b) a third party attempts to register, copy, imitate, illegally use, or improperly use the Huawei Brand;
    
    (c) a third party asserts that the use of the Huawei Brand infringes upon its rights; or
    
    (d) any other matters arise where a third party is likely to infringe upon or harm the Huawei Brand.
