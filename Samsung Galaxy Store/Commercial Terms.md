    To the fullest extent permitted by law, we expressly exclude all representations, conditions, warranties or other terms which apply to the Services and associated content/information including any implied warranties of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular or any purpose or non-infringement which might otherwise apply but for this clause.  
      
    You will be solely responsible for your Applications to be distributed through the STORE and Samsung disclaims any liability arising out of your Applications.

When these changes are made, Samsung will provide you at least 15 days’ prior notice (or in case of material change or change requiring you to make significant technical or commercial adaptations to your Applications, 30 days’ prior notice) unless the changes are required to make the Terms compliant with any applicable law and make a new copy of the Terms or the Documentation available at the Seller Portal and any new additional terms will be made available to you from within, or through, the affected Services.

19\. General legal terms

1. 19.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.
2. 19.2 The Terms and the documents referred to in these Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Samsung and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Samsung may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Samsung in relation to the Services.
3. 19.3 You agree that Samsung may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.
4. 19.4 You agree that if Samsung does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Samsung has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Samsung's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Samsung.
5. 19.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.
6. 19.6 You acknowledge and agree that each Samsung affiliated company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms. For the purposes of this Agreement, an affiliated company of Samsung is any company, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity that controls Samsung, is controlled by Samsung or is under common control with Samsung; the term controls and controlled meaning the ability to direct the management of the relevant entity.
7. 19.7 You may not transfer, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of this Agreement, or any of your rights or obligations arising under it, without our prior written consent.

Our performance under the Agreement is deemed to be suspended for the period that the Force Majeure Event continues, and we will have an extension of time for performance for the duration of that period. We will use our reasonable endeavours to bring the Force Majeure Event to a close or to find a solution by which our obligations under the Agreement may be performed despite the Force Majeure Event.
9. 19.9 The Terms, and your relationship with Samsung under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Samsung agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in London to resolve any legal matter arising out of or connected to these Terms (including non-contractual matters). Notwithstanding this, you agree that Samsung shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
10. 19.10 You can make a complaint about any alleged breach of this Agreement or the technology underpinning the Services, by emailing the complaint to [appscsteam@samsung.com](mailto:appscsteam@samsung.com) with the title “Samsung Galaxy Store – Internal Dispute Resolution Required”.

Save for these specific amendments the mediation shall operate in accordance with the model procedure of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution, London, such mediation to be completed within 30 days of signature of the relevant mediation agreement.
