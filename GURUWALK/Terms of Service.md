These terms and conditions may be updated and ratified again prior to the conclusion of a tour at any time.

**1) GURUWALK IDENTIFICATION**

The ownership of this website, [https://www.guruwalk.com](https://www.guruwalk.com/) is held by Guruwalk, S.L., with registered office at Calle Guillem de Castro 9, 46007 Valencia, TAX ID B98958648, registered in the Mercantile Register of Valencia, Volume 10407, Book 7688 Folio 44, Section 8 and Sheet number V179201, hereinafter **GURUWALK**.

If you have any questions regarding these terms and conditions, please contact us by any of the means indicated.

**2) PURPOSE OF THE WEBSITE**

**GURUWALK** acts as an intermediary in the booking of activities relating to the contact between those interested in tourist routes (the **Walkers**) and the guides who organise them (hereinafter "**Gurus**" or "**tour providers**"), through its website [www.guruwalk.com](https://www.guruwalk.com/) (hereinafter the **Website**).

**Gurus** perform and organise the cultural, entertainment, leisure and recreational activities (hereinafter referred to as Tours) for **Walkers** at their own risk and by their own means.

The Platform allows **Gurus** and **Walkers** to get in touch to enjoy the different experiences organised by the Gurus. In this way, **GURUWALK** operates as an intermediary platform.

**3) REGISTRATION AND BOOKING SYSTEM**

To create an account, you will need to provide the following personal information in order to create a registered **Walker** profile: email address, full name, city where you live. Subsequently, when making a reservation, you will be asked, as in the case of **Walkers** without a registered account, for the number of companions and a contact telephone number so that the **Guru** can contact you.

By making a booking, you accept and agree to abide by the terms and conditions.

**4) THE TOUR PROVIDER (GUIDE) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ORGANISATION AND RUNNING OF THE TOUR**

**GURUWALK** does not organise or offer any tours of its own and is therefore not directly responsible for tours organised by a guide. Please note that **GURUWALK** only facilitates the contact between the **Walker**, as the person looking for a tour, and the guide, so **GURUWALK** does not guarantee in any way the correct performance of the tour.

It is the sole responsibility of the tour provider or **Guru** to ensure the accuracy, legitimacy and correctness of all content and information it provides on the Platform pertaining to its tour and services. In any case, as a **Walker**, you can access the opinions about the satisfaction or rating of the tour, which can serve as a reference before hiring a tour.

By making a reservation and booking a tour, you are contracting with the specific provider of that tour, adhering to the conditions that have been established between you, without **GURUWALK** being part of that contract and/or having any responsibility for any vicissitude related to it (performance of the tour, quality of the tour, cancellations, delays, non-compliance, accidents during the tour, etc).

Any complaint about this performance must be made solely and exclusively to the **tour provider** with whom you freely decided to contract. It will be up to the **tour provider** to decide how to resolve any claims you have made in relation to the agreement you have reached.

**5) IF YOU ARE BRINGING ACCOMPANYING PERSONS ON A ROUTE, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO INFORM THEM**

If you book a tour in which any accompanying person(s) will participate, you guarantee that you will inform the accompanying person(s) of these terms and conditions and that the accompanying person(s) understands and accepts these terms and conditions.

**6) CONFIRMATION OF TOUR BOOKINGS AND OPERATION**

You will receive the booking confirmation via email after completing the booking process, which includes all the information available to **GURUWALK** about the specific tour according to the information provided by the **tour provider**.

By making a tour booking, you agree to the **tour providers'** policies including all no-show, cancellation and check-in policies shown or stated in their terms and conditions. Again, we remind you that the tour is contracted with a **third-party tour provider**, not with **GURUWALK**, so the contract that will govern the provision of tour services will be the one agreed with the specific provider, and the responsibility for the correct and legitimate provision of the service will be that of the provider.

It is your responsibility to notify the **tour provider** directly to make any amendments to the booking or to inform them of any special requirements/facilities that you or your accompanying person(s) may require.

The list of **tour providers** on **GURUWALK** should not be considered as a specific recommendation by **GURUWALK**, which only offers the services of the **tour providers** that are registered on the Platform, trying at all times to ensure that the quality of the same is adequate, but without being responsible for the correct provision of the tour escort services.

**7) RATING SYSTEM AND COMMENTS ON PROFILES AND ROUTES**

The Platform makes a rating system available to the user through which the user can review the rating that other users have given to the services provided by certain **tour providers**, as well as the comments that other users have left about their experience. **GURUWALK** is not responsible for the opinions and ratings given by other users. You are the only one who must decide which tour to choose, and you do so at your own risk, and in the same way, as a user, you can provide your opinion, assessment, and comments on tours you have taken.

**GURUWALK** reserves the right to remove all comments and contributions that violate the respect for the dignity of the person, that are discriminatory, xenophobic, racist, pornographic, that violate youth or childhood, public order, or safety or that, in its opinion, are not appropriate for publication. In any case, **GURUWALK** will not be responsible for the opinions expressed by users through the participation tools.

You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Platform, and you are aware that **GURUWALK** is not responsible for the conduct of other users. While **GURUWALK** strives to maintain cordial and respectful relationships between users, **GURUWALK** reserves the right to monitor or become involved in your conflicts with other users. We ask you to act with common sense and use your best judgement when interacting with other users, avoiding swearing, offensive expressions or expressions that may offend the sensibilities of other users of the Platform.

**8) PROHIBITED USES OF THE PLATFORM**
