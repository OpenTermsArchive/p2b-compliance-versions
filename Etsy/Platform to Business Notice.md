Europea≠n Union Platform-to-Business Regulation on Etsy
=======================================================

The European Union (EU) Regulation on platform-to-business relations (P2B Regulation) intends to create a fair, transparent, and predictable business environment for sellers on online platforms. The P2B Regulation applies to sellers located in the EU that also offer their products to consumers in the EU.

**Etsy’s Policies**
-------------------

To foster transparency and fairness, we’ve put a great deal of effort into ensuring that our agreement with users of our service is worded in a clear and comprehensible way. [Our House Rules](https://www.etsy.com/legal), which encompasses a broad family of policies for all users of our services (like [Etsy’s Terms of Use](https://www.etsy.com/legal/terms-of-use) and [Seller Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/sellers)), are easily accessible in the footer of just about every page on Etsy.com and at [https://www.etsy.com/legal](https://www.etsy.com/legal/section/sellers). 

[Sellers on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/section/sellers) agree to important policies and standards such as:

* [Handmade Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/handmade)
* [Prohibited Items Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/prohibited/?ref=list)
* [Intellectual Property Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/ip/?ref=list)
* [Sanctions Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/sanctions-policy/122383404929?ref=list)
* [Fees & Payments Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/fees)
* [Anti-Discrimination and Hate Speech Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/anti-discrimination-and-hate-speech/123551108902)
* [Seller Service Level Standards](https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000345068?segment=selling) 

If Etsy has reason to believe a seller has violated any of these policies, their shop, shop content, or accounts may be deactivated, suspended or terminated.

**How does the P2B regulation impact EU sellers?**
--------------------------------------------------

Generally, Etsy will notify sellers of actions affecting their listings, shop, or account. However, we may not provide a notification if we have legal or regulatory reasons that prevent us from doing so, or if the seller has been terminated due to repeatedly violating our policies.

Etsy will duly consider P2B inquiries in accordance with the regulation, and will process them within a reasonable frame of time, taking into consideration the importance and complexity of the issue. We will provide a response regarding the outcome where appropriate and not restricted by legal or regulatory reasons. If we determine that an action was taken as a result of an error, the action will be reversed as soon as possible. Duplicative, abusive, or other bad faith inquiries will be handled accordingly.

### **My shop, account, or listing has been actioned by Etsy in error. What should I do?**

Sellers in the EU who believe an action that Etsy has taken on their shop, account, or listing was the result of an error should respond to the email notification they received, unless directed otherwise within the email (for example, a [notification of alleged intellectual property infringement](https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034079714-Why-Did-I-Receive-a-Notice-of-Intellectual-Property-Infringement-?segment=selling) states that the seller should directly contact the complaining party). Email notifications about a permanent account action will provide information about the opportunity to [appeal that decision](https://help.etsy.com/hc/articles/6298920789271?segment=selling). 

### **I’m an EU seller and have concerns related to P2B. How can I contact Etsy?**

If you are a seller based in the EU and have concerns related to P2B, please [**let us know**](https://www.etsy.com/sso-forced/zendesk/aHR0cHM6Ly9oZWxwLmV0c3kuY29tL2hjL3JlcXVlc3RzL25ldz9zZWdtZW50PXNlbGxpbmcjaXNzdWVfYWNjb3VudF9wMmItc29sdXRpb25fcHJpbWFyeQ).

EU sellers may review our [Terms of Use](https://www.etsy.com/legal/terms-of-use) to see additional information relevant to the P2B Regulation, including mediation options and disclosures regarding search and ad ranking.
