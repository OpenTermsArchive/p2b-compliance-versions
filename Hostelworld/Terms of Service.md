from the Licensee and, accordingly, the Licensee agrees that throughout the Term it will:



• 1.1.1. provide HW immediately upon acceptance of these Terms and Conditions

may require to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of HW or any appropriate

necessary to be able to do this), including bookings made during special event

Customers;

Licensee’s own website(s)) on a no less favourable basis and always on a real-time

basis (i.e. first come first served) and with "last bed / room availability". This

accommodation offered by the Licensee pursuant to clause 1.2.1 (above) refund

occupier’s liability, (ii) public liability insurance and (iii) all other risks which it would

be reasonable to insure against including cover for death, personal injury and illness

(including all legal costs of both the Customers concerned and the Licensee) of or

suffered by the Customers and/or the Licensee’s employees, agents and

representatives arising, directly or indirectly, from any act(s) and/or default(s) by the

Licensee and/or any person(s) employed, contracted or instructed (directly or

indirectly) by the Licensee (including employees, agents, suppliers and sub-

contractors of the Licensee) and/or any use of the Property; and



• 1.4.2. the full amount of all sums which it is reasonably foreseeable could potentially

become payable pursuant to all or any of the indemnities provided by the Licensee

under this Agreement.



• 1.5. The aforementioned level of insurance cover held by the Licensee shall be kept

be at a level which a reputable, reasonable and prudent accommodation and/or travel

services provider would hold.

and renewal of the insurance policies referred to in clause 1.4.

results in any manner and according to any system of ranking that it determines to be

appropriate for each and any of the HW Websites. Currently, the HW Websites rank

ranking will be influenced by several factors, which may include: (i) the quality score that

determine the rankings and the weightings given to such factors on each or any of the

HW Websites and (ii) determine a Property’s eligibility to participate in varying its Service

Fee percentage to influence its ranking (where applicable).



4\. HW’S SERVICE FEES



• 4.1. The provisions of this clause 4.1 shall apply in respect of Beds. In consideration of

the provision of the HW Services by HW to the Licensee under the terms of this

Fee will be equal to a percentage of the Booking Price (as translated into the settlement

currency selected by the Customer) that all Customers making a booking via the

Websites would be charged for all the nights comprising their booking (whether or not

that booking is honoured, amended, subsequently cancelled (other than in the case of a

Free Cancellation Booking that is cancelled by the Customer during the Cancellation

Period) or the Customer fails to turn up). The percentage amount of the Booking Price

(as translated into the settlement currency selected by the Customer) that will comprise

the Standard Service Fee is specified in the Key Details at the beginning of this

Agreement and the parties reserve the right to agree to vary this Service Fee amount at

any time (the "Varied Service Fee"), for example in accordance with the programmes

operated by HW through which Licensees can vary the Service Fees they pay and the

Deposit that will be collected in return for certain benefits, such as the opportunity to seek

to improve their rankings within the display of search results on one or more of the HW

Websites. Licensees may be informed about updates to HW’s programmes in this regard

from time to time via email or Inbox.



• 4.2. The Licensee will pay the Service Fee (and any other amounts) due to HW under

this Agreement free and clear of all taxes, deductions or withholdings whatsoever, save

only as may be required by law. The Licensee agrees that if such taxes, deductions or

withholdings are required by law, the Licensee shall pay to HW such additional amount

as may be necessary in order that the net amount received by HW after such taxes,

deductions and withholdings shall not be less than the amount HW would have been

entitled to receive in the absence of any such taxes, deductions or withholdings.



• 4.3 For all Beds bookings, the Service Fee shall become payable on HW’s receipt of the

Deposit from the Customer (for which an invoice will be issued to the Licensee). Where

the Customer cancels a Free Cancellation Booking within the Cancellation Period, HW

shall issue a credit note to the Licensee in respect of the relevant Service Fee for such

cancelled bookings.

Customer, by means of an online debit, credit card and/or other online payments’

transaction at the time the booking is made. The percentage of the total Booking Price

(for all the nights comprising a Customer’s booking) that will comprise the Standard

Deposit is specified in the Key Details at the beginning of this Agreement and the parties

reserve the right to agree to vary the Deposit amount at any time, for example in

accordance with any scheme(s) or programme(s) operated by HW from time to time

through which Licensees can vary the Service Fee they pay and the Deposit that will be

collected in return for certain benefits (the "Varied Deposit"). HW shall hold the Deposit

on trust for the Licensee and shall (subject to the arrangements set out in Appendix 1 to

this Agreement) pay the Deposit to the Licensee in accordance with the terms of this

Agreement. Unless HW notifies the Licensee to the contrary, the Deposit will equal the

Service Fee.



• 5.2 In respect of each Customer booking for an Experience(s) which is made during the

Term, the Licensee shall collect the Experience Booking Price directly from the Customer

on the Customer’s arrival at the Property/ Experience. For the avoidance of doubt, no

portion of the Experience Booking Price shall be collected by Hostelworld at any time.



• 5.3. In respect of Beds, the Licensee will be responsible for collecting from the Customer

the balance payable to the Licensee (being the Booking Price less the Deposit (as

denominated in the currency in which it quotes its Base Rates) unless otherwise set out

in the Licensee’s terms and conditions and booking confirmation that is provided to the

Customer at time of booking), but such collection shall not take place until the

Customer’s arrival at the Property, unless otherwise specified in the Property Information

or if the booking is a Non-Refundable Booking.



• 5.4. The Customer Card Details which are collected by HW at the point of payment of the

Deposit will thereafter be made available to the Licensee (via HW’s extranet facility,

Inbox or Counter) so that either: (a) the balance due in respect of a booking (in the event

that (i) the Customer arrives at the Property and fulfils the booking, or (ii) the booking is a

Non-Refundable Booking) or (b) the Cancellation Fee, as defined in clause 5.5 (in the

event that they do not turn up) may be debited or obtained via that card by the Licensee

in accordance with HW’s customer terms and conditions which are displayed on the HW

Websites.



• 5.5. In the event of a failure by the Customer to turn up at the Property for their Bed

booking where the Customer has not cancelled the booking within the Cancellation

Period, the Licensee shall be entitled at its discretion to charge a cancellation fee which

is equal to or less than the full price of the first night’s stay of the booking, as

denominated in the currency in which it quotes its Base Rates, less the first night’s

Deposit (the "Cancellation Fee") (save in the case of Non-Refundable Bookings, where

the Licensee may take the balance of the payment for the full Booking Price in

accordance with clause 7A.1.2, but may not charge any additional cancellation fees, or

where the Licensee clearly stated to the Customer prior to the point of booking that the

Cancellation Fee would be higher). It shall be the responsibility of the Licensee to collect

any Cancellation Fee from the Customer.



• 5.6. The Licensee is responsible for (i) updating and maintaining the pricing for its Beds

and Experiences through the Management Tools and (ii) any data entry errors which may

arise in respect of pricing. This responsibility includes ensuring that the correct pricing

and availability is displayed for special event periods.



• 5.7. HW may at its own discretion charge a booking (or other processing) fee to

Customers at the time of booking and the amount of that fee shall be determined by HW.

HW may also offer ancillary products and services to Customers at the time of or after

their booking, for which it may charge the Customers a fee. Any such fees shall be for the

account of HW notwithstanding that the fees may be charged to the Customer at the

same time that the Deposit is collected from the Customer on behalf of the Licensee.

• 5.8. Following termination or expiry of this Agreement, Service Fees shall continue to be

payable by the Licensee in respect of Customer bookings which were made during the

Term.



• 5.9. In the event that a Customer cancels a Non-Refundable Booking in respect of which

they have paid taxes that are no longer payable because they have not availed of the

relevant Beds, it shall be the responsibility of the Property to reimburse such Customers

for any such taxes.



• 5.10. In respect of Experiences, the Licensee’s cancellation policy shall apply to all

Experience bookings. However, notwithstanding the forgoing, HW reserves the right to

extend the period for cancellation by a Customer. For example, the Licensee may allow

free cancellation within 3 days of making an Experience booking but HW shall have the

right to extend this period out to, for example, 7 days.

• 6.6. The Licensee hereby indemnifies HW for the full amount of all claims, liabilities,

demands, damages, expenses, losses, refunds, fines, costs (including all legal costs)

and all other sums of whatever nature which HW incurs, suffers or becomes responsible

(i) withhold a certain percentage of the balance of the payment for the booking (i.e. the

Booking Price minus the Deposit); or (ii) debiting the Licensee’s bank account. The

amount of the Reserve will be based upon the level (or expected level) of refunds,

disputed charges, chargebacks, customer complaints, hostel liquidation/ bankruptcy, acts

of default, allegations of fraud or changes in the Licensee’s underlying risk profile.

Hostelworld will reduce the Reserve once the reason for establishing the Reserve no

longer exists.

responsibility of the Licensee, and Licensee shall promptly and fully reimburse HW for

entitled to a refund of the Deposit. HW agrees that it shall transfer the Deposit that it has

collected from the Customer back to the Customer on behalf of the Licensee where a

Customer cancels a Free Cancellation Booking during the Cancellation Period. For the

the Customer) in respect of such transfer of the Deposit back to the Customer.



9\. RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY



• 9.1. The Licensee hereby grants to HW the authority to conclude bookings with

Customers on behalf of the Licensee and further agrees that HW has no responsibility to

the Customer for the fulfilment of bookings. In concluding such a booking, HW acts as

commercial agent on behalf of the Licensee only (and not on behalf of the Customer). A

booking creates an agreement between the Customer and the Licensee and the

Licensee hereby agrees to indemnify HW in respect of all losses, costs and damage

suffered or incurred by HW as a result of any claims being brought against HW which

relate to a booking and/or the provision of a Bed, Experience and/or any other service

provided by the Licensee (save to the extent that such loss, cost or damage is caused by

the negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation of HW).



• 9.2. Subject to clause 9.5, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that HW shall have

no liability to the Licensee, any member of its corporate group or any other person which

arising out of or in connection with this Agreement: (i) loss of data, income, profit,

business or opportunity, (ii) damages, losses and costs that relate to third party claims

shall be limited to €5,000.



• 9.4. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the existence of the agency

relationship described herein shall be disclosed to the Customer so that the Customer is

made aware that (inter alia) the Customer is contracting with the Licensee and not HW in

relation to the provision of the Beds and Experiences, that the amount paid by the

Customer at the time of booking is a deposit which is collected by HW on behalf of the

Licensee and that the final price payable by the Customer to the Licensee shall be

reduced by the amount of such deposit.



• 9.5. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement is

intended to or shall take effect to limit or exclude the liability of either party for; (i) the

undertakings with respect to such services and deliverables and, to the greatest extent

permitted by applicable law, HW hereby excludes all representations, warranties and

conditions, express or implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation

warranties as to quality or fitness for a particular purpose.



• 9.8. Where a booking is cancelled because of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event,

the Licensee shall (i) in the case of Non-Refundable Bookings, refund the Customer the

monies collected by the Licensee pursuant to clause 7A.1.2, and (ii) in the case of

Deposit Model Bookings, not charge the Customer the Cancellation Fee.



• 9.9. Save in relation to the obligations under clause 9.8, neither party shall be liable to

the other for any failure or delay in performing this Agreement to the extent that such

failure or delay is caused by a Force Majeure Event.

• 9.10. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that HW does not guarantee access to

the Management Tools through which Service Fee levels can be varied and that HW

does not have any liability for any system failures, downtime, loss of internet connection

or any other situation that prevents or delays a Licensee from amending its Service Fee

levels at the time or in the manner that it wishes. HW will use reasonable endeavours to

minimise the amount of time that the administration interface will be unavailable and to

work with the Licensee in order to, where and to the extent reasonably possible, mitigate

the impact of such an incident on the Licensee’s business.

• 13.2. HW shall be entitled to vary any of the terms of this Agreement at any time by

giving you notice as follows, unless the P2B Regulation permits us to provide no notice or

a shorter period of notice: (a) if we change the Service Fee, we will provide you with at

least 30 days’ advance written notice; (b) if the changes to any of the terms of this

Agreement would require you to make technical or commercial adaptations to the goods

or services you offer to Customers through the applicable P2B Services, we will give you

a minimum of 30 days’ advance written notice (or such other notice period that is

reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances); and (c) if we otherwise substantively

modify the HW Terms we will provide you with at least 30 days’ advance written notice.

All such variations shall be effective upon expiration of the 30 day notice period or by

their direct communication to the Licensee, unless otherwise noted and the Licensee’s

continued use of the HW Services after the changes have taken effect will constitute

acceptance of the changes. Subject to the forgoing, no other variations of this Agreement

shall be effective unless in writing and signed by or on behalf of both parties.



• 13.3. Without prejudice to clause 2.7, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) all

transfers of Customer personal data from HW to the Licensee operate on a controller to

controller basis, and (ii) they are each separately responsible for compliance with all

relevant data protection legislation and laws relating to privacy in all relevant jurisdictions

(the "Data Protection Legislation") in relation to their own respective activities. The

Licensee also agrees that it shall protect and respect all personal data that it receives

relating to its Customers and shall comply with all Data Protection Legislation and shall

not do anything which (or omit to do anything the omission of which) would put HW in

breach of any Data Protection Legislation (and in particular the Licensee shall not

disclose any Customer Card Details to any person other than as necessary to effect a

lawful payment for a Bed or a booking or as required by law).



• 13.4. The Licensee hereby agrees in advance that HW is freely entitled to transfer all of

its rights and obligations under this Agreement to (i) any third party acquiring all or a

conditions that may be introduced by HW in the future. For the avoidance of doubt it is

HW’s opinion that none of these terms and conditions listed in (i) to (ii) of this clause

version shall prevail and be binding and conclusive. The English version shall be used in

any and all legal proceedings.

of Ireland, and HW and the Licensee agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts.

money or handles payment transactions between the Licensee and a Customer, or

accesses the Licensee’s Connect Account in connection with such transactions, HW

does so exclusively as a commercial agent of the Licensee authorised via this Agreement

to negotiate or conclude the sale or purchase of goods or services on behalf only of the

Licensee (and not on behalf of the Customer). Any such transmission of money or

access to the Licensee’s Connect Account by HW under this Agreement is provided on a

basis that is ancillary to other services provided by HW .



Certain Licensees connect to HW’s IT system and obtain the benefit of the HW Services via an

API and using their own property management system or a third-party management system. The

following clause 14 only applies (respectively) to those Licensees that use the HW technology in

this way.

This clause only relates to and is only binding on those Licensees that connect to HW’s IT

system via an API.

time in its absolute discretion in the event that the connection causes: (a) the HW system

to suffer technical problems and/or (b) the HW system becoming overloaded and/or (c)

the HW system’s processing or response times to significantly increase. HW values all

their accommodation partners who connect via the API and will not take such action

lightly or without making reasonable attempts to notify any Licensees who would be or

might be suspended as a result of this action, ideally in advance of but possibly during or

after such a suspension of services. Furthermore, HW will endeavour to minimise the

amount of time for which the API is suspended and to work with the Licensees to, where

reasonably possible, mitigate the impact of such a suspension on the Licensees

business.



• 14.2. The Licensee is responsible for ensuring that its API connectivity provider has the

capacity and functionality to be able to provide reporting to HW that shows the level of

Bed / Bedroom and/or Experience availability and allocation provided to HW, both

historically and by way of projections for the future.

shall instruct HW to apply the Promotional Tools for (the "Promotional Term").



• 15.3. The Licensee is required to instruct HW as to whether it wishes to apply either the

Mobile Only Rates deal or the App Only Rates deal or both. Only HW may apply or

disapply the Promotional Tools. HW shall act on the Licensee’s written instruction in

relation to the application or disapplication of the chosen Promotional Tool(s) and will

implement such instruction within three (3) working days. The Licensee shall at all times

determine the pricing of its Inventory.



• 15.4. The Promotional Tools can only be applied to the Licensee’s Inventory as displayed

either on the HW mobile website, mobile application, tablet application and tablet

website. For the avoidance of doubt, the Promotional Tools cannot be applied to the

Licensee’s Inventory as displayed on the HW desktop website. Once the Promotional

Tools have been applied and for the Promotional Term, (i) the Discount will apply to the

Licensee’s total displayed Inventory on the HW mobile website, mobile application, tablet

application and tablet website or all of them, and (ii) all bookings made via the HW mobile

website, mobile application, tablet application or tablet website or will use the discounted

rate as the Base Rate.



• 15.5. HW reserves the right to monitor the use of the Promotional Tools and may in its

sole discretion and at any time disapply it in relation to the Licensee for any reason.

Nothing shall restrict the Licensee from, at any time, directly promoting the availability of

any Inventory under its ownership or control on or from its website domains or third party

platform.



• 15.6. Hostelworld may terminate or suspend the Promotional Tools for any reason and

without incurring any penalties as to termination on three (3) days’ written notice.

including shelter and a comfortable resting area; (iii) freedom from pain, injury, or disease

by treating animals respectfully and providing prompt access to veterinary care; (iv)

freedom to express normal behaviour by providing sufficient space, proper facilities, and

allowing for company of the animal's own kind; and (v) freedom from fear and distress by

ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering.

employees or other persons associated with it has been or is the subject of any

investigation, inquiry or enforcement proceedings by any governmental, administrative or

regulatory body regarding any offence or alleged offence of or in connection with the

Prohibited Practices; (ii) it shall comply with all applicable animal welfare laws, statutes,

regulations and codes; and (iii) it shall ensure that animals (including but not limited to

animals of whatever species for any form of entertainment\*) shall not be caused any

harm, suffering or distress as a result of any experiences, activities or events promoted,

managed, arranged or organised by the Licensee.



\* ‘Entertainment’ is an inclusive term taking in all form of animal acts.

of the Service Fee to HW by the Licensee:



• 1.1. in the event that the Deposit exceeds the Service Fee, HW shall retain the proportion

of the deposit that equals the Service Fee and shall pay the remainder to the Licensee;



• 1.2. in the event that the Deposit is less than the Service Fee, HW will retain the entire

deposit and the Licensee shall pay the difference to HW;



• 1.3. in the event that the Deposit is equal to the Service Fee, HW shall retain the entire

deposit and no further sums shall become due from either party to the other; and



• 1.4. in the event that HW, acting on behalf of the Licensee, is ever required by law to

refund the Deposit to a Customer, the Licensee shall pay the entire Service Fee to HW.



2\. Where the Licensee is required to make a payment to HW pursuant to paragraphs 1.2 or 1.4,

of this Appendix 1 the Licensee will effect payment of such sums either by setting up a form of

direct debit or automated credit card payment, such that the appropriate amount can be collected

by HW on a daily basis (save where an alternative form of payment is agreed by both parties).

Where HW is required to make a payment to the Licensee pursuant to paragraph 1.1 of this

Appendix 1, HW will make the payment in a timely fashion, either by means of an aggregated

payment which is calculated and made on a monthly basis or by such alternative method as HW

may instigate (acting reasonably) from time to time.
