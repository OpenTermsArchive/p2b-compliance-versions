### Summary

This is a summary of our Partner Terms of Business. It should not be a substitute for reading the full version below. Capitalised terms used in this summary are defined in the Partner Terms of Business.

*   Treatwell provides:

*   a **booking platform** on which you can advertise the Partner Services which you offer in your salon/spa to a much wider range of potential customers;
*   a **salon diary management system** called ‘Connect’ which comes with a range of features to help you manage your business; and
*   **add-on features and services** such as a booking widget to add to your social media pages or own website, a customised website for your venue, and “point of sale” software and hardware to help manage your payments.

*   You may choose to receive some or all of the above Treatwell Services. If you choose not to receive all of the Treatwell Services, certain terms contained in the Partner Terms of Business will not be relevant to you. E.g. If the services you receive from Treatwell do not include the booking platform, terms regarding Bookings (excluding Widget Bookings), Commission, and any other terms relevant only to the booking platform, will not apply to you.
*   We are responsible for arranging and concluding Treatwell Bookings and Prepaid Widget Bookings and are appointed under these Terms of Business as your commercial agent to do so.
*   For Prepaid Widget Bookings and Treatwell Bookings, we will collect payments from Prepaid Widget Customers and/or Treatwell Customers on your behalf and successful receipt of payment by us from Customers will discharge their debt to you.
*   If Treatwell Customers decide to “Pay at Venue”, we will either deduct our Commission from what we owe you or, if we do not hold sufficient funds, the amount payable by you to us will be set out in your Invoice Statement.
*   We will send you an Invoice Statement twice a month which will set out what we owe you for Fulfilled Bookings, what you owe us (e.g. Commission, Processing Fees, any Sign-Up Fee etc.) and the resulting balance (whether you owe us, we owe you or the balance is settled).

*   If we owe you, we will pay this to your bank account within 3-5 Business Days of the date of the Invoice Statement.
*   If you owe us, we will initiate payment of the Invoice Statement on your behalf, in accordance with authorisation given by you on accepting this Agreement and providing your details in Connect. If no permission to take recurring payments has been given, we ask that you pay us within 14 days of the date of the Invoice Statement.
*   If the balance is settled, we will explain on the Invoice Statement that there is nothing further needed.  
    If in a particular month it is difficult for you to pay the outstanding balance within the specified time limit, please get in touch as soon as possible.  
    Please note that the Sign-Up Fee is **non-refundable**.

*   In order to ensure all payments are processed securely and in compliance with payment regulations, payment processing services for Partners are provided by Stripe and are subject to the [Stripe connected account agreement](https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms), which includes the [Stripe terms of service](https://stripe.com/legal) (collectively, the **“Stripe Services Agreement”**).By agreeing to these Partner Terms of Business and continuing to use the Treatwell Services, Partner agrees to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as may be modified by Stripe from time to time. Subject to agreeing to the Stripe Services Agreement and to receiving approval from Stripe to become a Stripe Connected Account, there are additional terms which must be adhered to by the Partner in order for Treatwell to enable the Stripe Services. These are set out in clause 10 of the Partner Terms of Business.
*   Whether a Treatwell Booking is treated as a New Booking or a Repeat Booking (and therefore whether Commission or a Processing Fee is chargeable) depends on when the Customer last had a Successful Appointment (see definition below) in the Partner’s venue and whether they exist in the Customer Database and if so, when they were created in the Customer Database. A Customer will be identified using their (1) email address; or (2) phone number together with their first name.
*   New Bookings include those where the Customer has not had a Successful Appointment at the Partner’s venue in the last 365 days, and Repeat Bookings are Bookings by Customers who have had a Successful Appointment in the past 365 days. **It is very important that you read the full definitions of New and Repeat Bookings. These are contained in clause 2 under these Terms of Business.**
*   Widget Bookings will always be subject to a Processing Fee (not Commission).
*   You may choose to receive our “point of sale” software module which is fully integrated with Connect (**Treatwell POS Software**), and/or accompanying cash drawer with integrated receipt printer (Star Micronics mPOP) (**Treatwell POS Hardware**). In order to receive Treatwell POS Software, Partners must elect to do so in the Cooperation Agreement or otherwise and must indicate whether they also want to receive Treatwell POS Hardware. The Fee for Treatwell POS Hardware must be paid to Treatwell in advance. **It is very important that you read the full terms which apply to Treatwell POS in clause 5 of the Partner Terms of Business prior to ordering.**
*   You are responsible for the Partner Services which you provide to Customers in your spa / salon and the contract for those Partner Services is between you and the Customer. **We are in no way liable to Customers for the Partner Services they receive from you.**
*   You have a number of obligations to Treatwell in return for receiving the Treatwell Services. These are set out in detail in the Partner Terms of Business but some important ones are as follows:

*   You agree to pay us all applicable Charges (such as but not limited to Sign- Up Fees, Processing Fees, Commission and monthly costs etc.) and you hereby authorise Treatwell to initiate payment of the Sign-Up Fee and any Invoice Statement on your behalf. **Please note services are subject to the reverse charge rule and VAT has to be accounted for by the recipient a per Article 196 Council Directive 2006/112/EC. Therefore, it is mandatory that you provide your VAT number.**
*   You agree not to invite Treatwell Customers or Widget Customers to make Bookings otherwise than through the Website, the App, Distribution Channels or Widget (as applicable). Soliciting Treatwell Customers in this way could lead to an unavoidable increase in Charges as we rely on Partners working in partnership with us and using the Treatwell Services in good faith.
*   You agree to process and supply the Partner Services according to the highest standards applicable to the industry.
*   You must at all times provide Partner Services on the Website, App, Partner Site and Widget for an accurate price that complies with the most competitive prices on the Partner’s own website. .Different prices on your website compared to that of the prices on the Website, App, Partner Site or Widget would create a bad customer experience and is not in line with the Treatwell partnership. This could also lead to an unavoidable increase in Charges. For the avoidance of doubt, the Partner is permitted to offer lower prices or special offers to a closed group of individuals, both on an offline, such as, for example, members of the Partner’s own loyalty scheme, directly in the Partner’s salon and also on other alternative sales platforms and we do not restrict your ability to do so.
*   You must ensure that you have all the licenses, permits, permissions, qualifications, powers and insurances you need to perform the Partner Services.
*   You must ensure that all Partner Content uploaded to your Page(s) is accurate, legally compliant and not misleading.
*   You must ensure that your trading identity and address is clearly visible to Customers in respect of all Treatwell Services used by you that are visible to Customers.

*   Your cancellation and rescheduling terms in respect of Prepaid Widget Bookings and Treatwell Bookings must comply with our Booking Terms and Conditions found here [www.treatwell.be/en/info/booking-terms-and-conditions/](https://www.treatwell.be/en/info/booking-terms-and-conditions/ "https://www.treatwell.be/en/info/booking-terms-and-conditions/") and with clause 6 of the full version of the Partner Terms on Business. In particular Customers should be allowed to request to reschedule a Treatwell Booking or Prepaid Widget Booking up until 1 hour before the time of the appointment and to cancel up to 24 hours before the time of the appointment.
*   In respect of PAV Widget Bookings, Treatwell is solely a technology provider and does not act as commercial booking agent. Customers and Partners are able to cancel PAV Widget Bookings up until the time of the appointment and no contract is created between the Customer and the Partner until the appointment takes place. Confirmation and reminder emails will be sent to Widget Customers from Connect on behalf of the Partner, but the Partner is responsible for providing the Partner Services to the Customer and handling any cancellations or rescheduling directly with the Customer or via the Widget itself. Treatwell has no further involvement in the PAV Widget Booking process and solely provides the technology to facilitate PAV Widget Bookings to be made.
*   If we need to contact you about Bookings or for any other reason related to the Treatwell Services, we may contact you by email, phone, SMS or Whatsapp using the contact information provided in Connect.
*   Neither Treatwell (nor any business that it controls) offers any of its own goods or services via the Treatwell P2B Services. In providing the Treatwell P2B Services, Treatwell acts solely as a marketplace for our Partners in respect of their Partner Services.
*   The order that Partners' listings are seen in Customer search results on the Website or App depends on a number of factors. Please see Clause 16of the full terms for further details.
*   If you would like to make a complaint about Treatwell or if you otherwise if you want to speak with us, please get in touch and we will be happy to assist you:

2.  Treatwell Services
    1.  In consideration of payment by the Partner of the Charges (save for in the case of a Free Trial) and the Partner performing all of its other obligations herein and subject to this Agreement, Treatwell shall provide the applicable Treatwell Services to the Partner, which shall (unless otherwise agreed) include a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and fully revocable licence to use Connect, the terms of which are set out in clause 3.
    2.  In respect of all Prepaid Widget Bookings and Treatwell Bookings, Treatwell shall act and is hereby appointed as agent at law for the Partner to conclude those Bookings with a Customer and (where applicable) collect and process payments on behalf of the Partner. Nothing herein shall prevent or limit the Partner from remaining fully responsible and liable for their provision and supply of Partner Services to Customers. Treatwell is solely a technology provider with respect to PAV Widget Bookings and has no direct relationship with Widget Customers in respect of PAV Widget Bookings.
    3.  Treatwell may contact the Partner via e-mail, telephone, SMS or Whatsapp using the contact information provided in Connect in connection with Bookings or other questions regarding Treatwell and / or the Partner Services.
    4.  Where a Partner has elected to receive Treatwell Services which attract Fees, if it wishes to cease receiving one or more of those Treatwell Services, the Partner must give Treatwell at least 30 days’ notice in writing and will remain liable to pay any applicable Fees for the duration of the notice period.
    5.  Treatwell may in its sole discretion, change the amount of any Fees and/or the rate of Commission at any time on 30 days’ notice to the Partner (**“Pricing Change Notice”**). The Partner’s continued use of the Treatwell Services after receipt of such Pricing Change Notice will be deemed acceptance of the new Fees and/or rate of Commission.
    6.  Whether a Treatwell Booking is treated as a New Booking or Repeat Booking (and therefore whether Commission or a Processing Fee is chargeable) depends on when the Customer last had a Successful Appointment at the Partner’s venue and whether the Customer exists in the Customer Database and, if so, when they were created. A Customer will be identified using their (1) email address; or (2) phone number together with their first name. Prepaid Widget Bookings will always be subject to a Processing Fee, not Commission.
    7.  A Treatwell Booking will be regarded as a **New Booking** if the Customer:
        1.  does not exist in the Customer Database at all; or
        2.  was created in the Customer Database more than 365 days ago and has not had a Successful Appointment at the Partner’s venue in the last 365 days; or
        3.  was created in the Customer Database less than 365 days ago as a result of an appointment which was not or has not yet become a Successful Appointment.  
            **In all other cases**, a Treatwell Booking will be considered a **Repeat Booking**.
        4.  In the case of a Matching Customer, the Customer and the Matching Customer will be merged together and the most recent Successful Appointment will be used to determine whether a Treatwell Booking is a New Booking or a Repeat Booking.
        5.  Where Treatwell offers the Partner a Free Trial, the Partner understands and accepts that these Partner Terms of Business will apply in full. The Partner hereby agrees to pay all applicable Charges following completion of the Free Trial and to provide its bank details to Treatwell via Connect prior to the end of the Free Trial. If the Partner fails to provide its bank details to Treatwell in accordance with this clause 2.9, the Partner understands and accepts that Treatwell shall cease the provision of some or all of the Treatwell Services with immediate effect and without further notice. Treatwell may in its sole discretion reinstate some or all of the Treatwell Services upon the Partner providing payment details to Treatwell. Treatwell shall not be liable to the Partner in any way for the immediate termination of the Treatwell Services, in accordance with clause 3.7 and subject to clause 13.2. . For the avoidance of doubt, neither Treatwell (nor any business that it controls) offers any of its own goods or services via any Treatwell P2B Services. Treatwell does not offer, or allow any third party to offer on its behalf, any ancillary goods or services to Customers prior to the end of the appointment (either independently or in collaboration with a Partner or a third party). However, if they wish, Partners are free to offer Customers any ancillary goods or services on any conditions they wish, such as selling shampoo at the end of a hair appointment.
3.  **Connect, Treatwell POS, Widget and Partner Site Licence – Service and access to data**
    1.  Subject to the payment of applicable Charges, the Partner may use Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and/or the Partner Site for the purpose of processing Bookings of Partner Services for and on behalf of itself only.
    2.  The Partner’s use of Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and/or the Partner Site is at the Partner’s sole risk. The service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.
    3.  Technical support is provided by email primarily and is a benefit for the Partner but is not a right of the Partner.
    4.  The Partner understands and accepts that:
        1.  Treatwell uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and the Partner Site;
        2.  Treatwell shall have administrator access to all parts of Connect, including those parts that have been specifically tailored for the Partner;
        3.  Treatwell will track, using third party tools such as Google Analytics and Snowplow, the Partner’s use of, and the Partner’s employees’ and contractors’ use of, Connect. The tracking will cover each single interaction the user has and the technical details of the browser and device being used and will include but not limited to (a) appointment creation, (b) editing employees, and (c) viewing the calendar. This tracking will assist Treatwell in understanding how Connect is used by Partners and will allow Treatwell to develop and improve Connect. The Partner is not entitled to access this data and has no rights to this data, and Partners cannot opt out of this tracking. The Partner is responsible for alerting its employees and contractors that such tracking will take place.

        7.  A Partner may access its account-related data and Customer data, including Customer contact details, by logging into its Connect account, and this may include reports with aggregated information about the Partner, its employees and Partner Customers. However, Partners have no access to Treatwell or Widget Customer locations, street addresses or other location details that may be shared by a Treatwell and/or Widget Customer with Treatwell.

For the avoidance of doubt, Partners are not entitled to export, nor do they have any right to, any User Generated Content.
        8.  Partners have no access to any data provided by or generated through the provision of Treatwell Services to all Treatwell’s Partners as a whole and/or all Customers as a whole (or any subset of those), whether in aggregated form or otherwise. However, Treatwell endeavours to share general trends at country/region level via occasional newsletters to Partners who have agreed to receive Treatwell marketing (e.g. how often Customers as a whole come back, how long they browse the Website for, etc).
        9.  Certain third parties may have access to data from time to time. Customer data and Partner data provided for the use of the Treatwell P2B Services or generated through their provision will only be shared with third parties as necessary for the proper provision of the Treatwell P2B Services. For other third parties with whom data may be shared, please see the Privacy & Cookie Policy here [www.treatwell.be/en/info/privacy-policy/](https://www.treatwell.be/en/info/privacy-policy/ "https://www.treatwell.be/en/info/privacy-policy/").

    5.  The Partner shall not:
        1.  reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit the whole or any part of Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget or the Partner Site;
        2.  allow any third party (including group companies of the Partner) to use or access Connect (including Treatwell POS) without express prior written permission from Treatwell (which may be denied or granted on such terms as Treatwell in its sole discretion may determine);
        3.  send unsolicited emails, SMS or other electronic forms of marketing to Customers via Connect (or otherwise); or
        4.  disclose, share or resell any Connect or Treatwell POS login details.
    6.  Treatwell does not warrant:
        1.  that Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and/or the Partner Site will meet the Partner’s specific requirements;
        2.  that Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and/or the Partner Site will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free;
        3.  that any information or results that may be obtained from the use of Connect or Treatwell POS will be accurate or reliable;
        4.  that the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by the Partner through Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and/or the Partner Site will meet the Partner’s requirements or expectations; or
        5.  that any errors in Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and/or the Partner Site will be corrected.
    7.  The Partner expressly understands and agrees that as regards its use of Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and/or the Partner Site, whether during a Free Trial or otherwise, subject to clause 13.2, Treatwell shall not be liable for any loss of income or profits, loss of contracts, loss of goodwill, loss of data, or other intangible losses or for any indirect or consequential loss or damage (even if Treatwell has been advised by the Partner of the possibility of such loss or damage) resulting from:
        1.  the Partner’s use of, or inability to use, Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and/or the Partner Site;
        2.  Treatwell ceasing the provision of the Treatwell Services upon expiry of the Free Trial;
        3.  unauthorised access to or alteration of the Partner’s transmissions or data;
        4.  statements or conduct of any third party on Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and/or the Partner Site; or
        5.  any other matter relating to Connect, Treatwell POS, the Widget and/or the Partner Site.
    8.  Treatwell will provide the Partner with a user account and password which allows the Partner to access Connect and/or Treatwell POS. The Partner shall safeguard and keep the user account details and password confidential and safely stored and shall not disclose them to any person other than those who need to have access to Connect and/or Treatwell POS and who are aware of the Partner’s obligations to keep those details secure. The Partner shall immediately notify Treatwell of any suspected security breach or improper use, including any use which would breach this Agreement, Treatwell’s reasonable instructions given from time to time and/or applicable law.
4.  **Photography Service - For the avoidance of doubt, this is not a Treatwell P2B Service and therefore not subject to the P2B Regulation.**  
      
    Treatwell may at its sole discretion offer the Photography Service to Partners under licence for an agreed fee, either included in the Sign-Up Fee or as a separate additional fee. Where Treatwell provides the Photography Service to a Partner the following additional terms and conditions shall apply:
    1.  No warranties or guarantees are made about the quality of the photographs taken by the Treatwell Photographer (the **“Photos”**) and/or their content or layout. It will be the responsibility of the Partner to ensure that all necessary persons (if any) to be photographed are present at the appointment with the Treatwell Photographer to ensure that all consents to be photographed have been obtained from those who appear in Photos and to agree with the Treatwell Photographer that the set up and content of the Photos are to the Partner’s satisfaction.
    2.  The Partner may only use and publish the Photos on the following media: on the Website, App, Partner Site, Widget and the Distribution Channels (to the extent applicable). If the Partner wishes to use the Photos on their own website and/or social media pages, then the Widget must be installed. For the avoidance of doubt the Photos may not be used on any other online marketplace on which the Partner advertises the Partner Services. A limited amount of cropping is acceptable but no other editing of the Photos is permitted and Partners are strictly prohibited from removing any of Treatwell’s copyright notices from the Photos.
    3.  The Partner hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Photos are used under a non-exclusive and non-assignable licence that will automatically cease if the Partner leaves the Treatwell platform. With the exception of the rights under that licence, the Partner will not have any Intellectual Property Rights in the Photos. All Intellectual Property Rights in the Photos will be owned by Treatwell. For the avoidance of doubt, Treatwell may utilise the Photos in any of its own advertising and marketing campaigns, on the Website, App, Distribution Channels & its own social media channels and for any other purpose that it deems fit.
    4.  The Partner may not print, distribute, use, publish, exploit, edit, crop, alter or otherwise deal with the Photos except in accordance with clause 4.2 of this Agreement or with the prior written consent of Treatwell, to be given at the sole discretion of Treatwell and which may be subject to further Fees.
5.  **Treatwell POS - For the avoidance of doubt, this is not a Treatwell P2B Service and therefore not subject to the P2B Regulation.**  
      
    This clause 5 shall only apply to Partners who have ordered Treatwell POS in the Cooperation Agreement or otherwise.
    1.  One of the Treatwell Services offered to Partners is the use of Treatwell POS Software and/or Treatwell POS Hardware further details of which will be set out in the Cooperation Agreement (or as otherwise agreed separately between the Partner and Treatwell) and may differ from those set out in this Agreement. Treatwell POS Software and Treatwell POS Hardware shall together be referred to as **“Treatwell POS”**.
    2.  The Fee for Treatwell POS Hardware must be paid by the Partner to Treatwell in advance.
    3.  It is the Partner’s responsibility to familiarise itself with the functionality of Treatwell POS and its suitability for the Partner’s business operations. Treatwell makes no guarantee as to the operability of Treatwell POS Software or Treatwell POS Hardware nor their operability together. If the Partner purchases Treatwell POS Software without Treatwell POS Hardware, Treatwell will not be able to provide any support in integrating or setting up Treatwell POS Software with any third party hardware.
    4.  The Partner is responsible for its business and therefore also for any legal obligations concerning its business including but not limited to all tax and social security declarations and payments according to applicable law.  
          
        **Delivery of Treatwell POS Hardware**  
        
    5.  The Treatwell POS Hardware shall be delivered to the delivery address indicated by the Partner in the Cooperation Agreement or otherwise by email. Treatwell shall supply the Treatwell POS Hardware within 14 days from receipt of the Fee in full. This period may be extended in the event of circumstances beyond Treatwell’s control including but not limited to labour disputes, employee illness, issues with supply, or force majeure.
    6.  On passing the Treatwell POS Hardware to the delivery company, Treatwell’s obligations to the Partner in respect of delivery are discharged and risk of accidental damage or failed delivery is passed to the Partner at the point of sending. This shall apply irrespective of where the Treatwell POS Hardware is delivered from and/or who pays the delivery costs.  
          
        **Defects with Treatwell POS Hardware**  
        
    7.  Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the Partner’s rights in the event of defects to the Treatwell POS Hardware shall be as provided for by statute. Treatwell accepts no liability for public statements of the manufacturer or other third parties (e.g. advertising claims).
    8.  The Partner shall only be able to make defect claims if it has fulfilled its statutory duties of inspection and notification and has reviewed and followed Treatwell’s troubleshooting guide for the Treatwell POS Hardware in detail. If a fault appears upon inspection or later, it must be notified promptly to Treatwell in writing and no later than two weeks from discovering the defect. Notwithstanding the aforesaid duty of inspection and notification, the Partner shall notify obvious defects within two weeks from delivery. Treatwell shall not be liable if the Partner fails to make proper inspection and/or give proper notification of the defect. Treatwell will provide a parcel label for shipping the Treatwell POS Hardware to Treatwell for examination.
    9.  The Partner shall have the option of renting temporary Treatwell POS Hardware (**“Loan Hardware”**) in the interim whilst the Treatwell POS Hardware is inspected which will be sent within three working days after notification of the defect, subject always to availability of Loan Hardware. Treatwell shall charge an exchange Fee of €99.00 (excluding VAT) to the Partner for the Loan Hardware. Treatwell shall refund the exchange Fee to the Partner in full if a defect exists in the Treatwell POS Hardware for which Treatwell is liable. Exchange Fees shall not be refunded in any other case. In return, the Partner shall be obliged to send the Loan Hardware back to Treatwell immediately after Treatwell has eliminated all defects or confirmed no defects for which Treatwell is liable exist.
    10.  If defects are found in Treatwell POS Hardware for which Treatwell is liable, Treatwell may either, always at its sole discretion, rectify the fault in the existing Treatwell POS Hardware or provide replacement Treatwell POS Hardware. Remediation shall not encompass either de-installation of the faulty item nor reinstallation if Treatwell was not originally obligated to install it. Treatwell shall always be granted reasonable time and opportunity to remedy defects.
    11.  If a defect does exist, any expenses for testing or remediation, in particular transport, travel, labour and materials costs (but not de-installation and installation costs) shall be borne by Treatwell. Otherwise, Treatwell may demand reimbursement of the costs (in particular testing and transport costs and costs of any exchanged device) from the Partner, unless the absence of a fault was not recognisable for the Partner. Even if a defect exists, the Partner shall only have a claim to compensation and/or the reimbursement of fruitless expenditure in accordance with clause 13 of this Agreement, all other such claims shall be excluded.
    12.  No defect may be claimed where there is only an insignificant deviation from the agreed quality, where usability is affected only insignificantly, in cases of natural wear and tear or for damage arising after the transfer of risk due to incorrect or negligent handling, overuse, or due to particular outside influences that were not provided for under the contract. If improper maintenance work or changes are made by the Partner or a third party, no defect may be claimed in respect of said work or changes or the consequences thereof.
    13.  If remediation fails, the Partner may, without prejudice to any claims for compensation, withdraw from the Cooperation Agreement or choose to stop receiving the Treatwell POS Hardware and paying the associated Fee. Remediation shall be deemed to have failed if two replacement deliveries have also been faulty or if rectification or repair has twice been performed without success.
    14.  Claims for defects shall expire 12 months after delivery of the Treatwell POS Hardware to the Partner’s delivery address. The foregoing provision shall not apply insofar as a mandatory longer period is prescribed by law.  
          
        **Back-up of Treatwell POS Data**  
        
    15.  When using Treatwell POS, the Partner shall be responsible for the regular (e.g. daily) back-up of data. Despite regular data back-up, Treatwell cannot guarantee the complete back-up of all data entered into Treatwell POS. Treatwell shall in particular not be liable for losses that arise because the Partner has failed to back up its data. The Partner shall therefore be responsible for taking steps to prevent the potential temporary failure of Treatwell POS. Treatwell cannot guarantee the uninterrupted availability of Treatwell POS. Treatwell shall not be liable for losses, in particular loss of profit, that arise because the Partner has failed to take effective steps to ensure that operation of the business continues in the event of a temporary failure of Treatwell POS.
6.  **Partner Obligations**
    1.  In consideration of receiving the Treatwell Services, the Partner agrees to pay all applicable Charges to Treatwell and to accept all Bookings and process and supply the Partner Services to the highest industry standards and in line with any specific terms and conditions set out in this Agreement generally, and particularly in this clause 6. A breach of this clause 6.1 will be a Material Breach of this Agreement.
    2.  The Partner must accept all Bookings and may only decline to accept the same in exceptional circumstances, otherwise the Partner shall be considered to be in Material Breach of this Agreement and may forfeit any payments due to it in connection with this Agreement.
    3.  In respect of Prepaid Widget Bookings and Treatwell Bookings, the Partner is obliged to comply with the cancellation and rescheduling policy set out in clause 5 of the Booking Terms and Conditions. These can be viewed in full at [www.treatwell.be/en/info/booking-terms-and-conditions/](https://www.treatwell.be/en/info/booking-terms-and-conditions/ "https://www.treatwell.be/en/info/booking-terms-and-conditions/"). In summary:
        1.  Treatwell and/or the Partner will offer a refund in respect of Treatwell Bookings and Prepaid Widget Bookings which are cancelled (or unable to be rescheduled) provided the relevant appointment is not due to take place in the next 24 hours.
        2.  If a Customer wishes to change the date and/or time of a Prepaid Widget Booking or Treatwell Booking, provided the Customer requests to reschedule the appointment at least 1 hour prior to the time of the appointment, either via the Website or App, or by contacting the Partner or Treatwell, the Partner must endeavour to offer the Customer a suitable alternative booking time and/or date. In the event that a Partner is unable or unwilling to fulfil a Treatwell Booking or Prepaid Widget Booking pursuant to a Customer requesting such a change in accordance with this clause 6.3, the Customer may choose to proceed with the Booking or may cancel in accordance with clause 6.3(b), meaning that:
            1.  provided it is **at least** 24 hours before the appointment is due to take place, Treatwell will treat the Treatwell Booking or Prepaid Widget Booking as cancelled by the Customer and will refund the Customer the full amount; or
            2.  if it is **less than** 24 hours before the appointment is due to take place, Treatwell will treat the Treatwell Booking or Prepaid Widget Booking as cancelled by the Customer and no refund will be due.
        3.  If a Partner wishes to change the date and/or time of a Treatwell Booking or Prepaid Widget Booking, in the event that the Customer is unable or unwilling to agree to such change, Treatwell will treat the Treatwell Booking or Prepaid Widget Booking as cancelled by the Partner and will refund the Customer the full amount. However, if Treatwell deems it reasonable to do so in the circumstances, and at Treatwell’s sole discretion, Treatwell may still require the Partner to pay the applicable amount of Commission and/or Processing Fee that would have been due from the Partner in respect of that Treatwell Booking or Prepaid Widget Booking.
    4.  In respect of PAV Widget Bookings, Treatwell is solely a technology provider and does not act as commercial booking agent. Customers and Partners are able to cancel PAV Widget Bookings up until the time of the appointment and no contract is created between the Customer and the Partner until the appointment takes place. The Partner is responsible for providing the Partner Services to the Customer and handling any cancellations or rescheduling directly with the Customer. Treatwell has no further involvement in the PAV Widget Booking process and solely provides the technology to facilitate PAV Widget Bookings to be made. The Partner can select in Connect whether Customers will be given the opportunity to opt-in to email marketing from just the Partner or from the Partner and Treatwell.
    5.  The Partner is responsible for ensuring that all Partner Content (especially details of and prices for the Partner Services) that it publishes or provides to Treatwell to publish on the Page(s) is accurate, correct and not misleading. This includes only displaying prices as at a discount when those Partner Services have genuinely been available at a higher price previously and are only available at the discount price for a short period of time. Any breach of this clause 6.5 is a Material Breach of this Agreement.
    6.  The Partner procures that:
        1.  when uploading Partner Content which consists of photographs of an employee or contractor’s own work (**“Stylist Portfolio Photos”**), the Partner’s employees and contractors only upload Stylist Portfolio Photos in which they have the full copyright and/or permission to display the Stylist Portfolio Photos on on any and all platforms, for any purpose, including, but not limited to, marketing, advertising, commercial and/or editorial purposes throughout the world and for an indefinite period of time, including but not limited to on the Partner’s own website and social media channels, Partner Site, Widget the Partner’s website, Partner Site, Treatwell’s Website and App, Treatwell Lookbook and on any Distribution Channels;
        2.  Partner’s employees and contractors have obtained express written consent from any person or persons featured in the Stylist Portfolio Photos for them to be used in this way; and
        3.  the Stylist Portfolio Photos will not, in any way, contain nudity, obscenity or content which is likely to harass, upset, alarm, offend or which includes any sexually explicit, illegal or promotes violence or hate.
    7.  If at any time Treatwell suspects that Stylist Portfolio Photos have been uploaded without the appropriate rights or consent as set out in clause 6.6(a) and (b) above, or, at its sole discretion, Treatwell deems the Stylist Portfolio Photos to be inappropriate in any way in view of clause 6.6(c), this shall be a Material Breach of the Agreement and Treatwell, without limiting any other remedy it may wish to seek, may remove the Stylist Portfolio Photos at its sole discretion.
    8.  Partner is responsible and agrees to fulfil all statutory information obligations, including but not limited to the obligation to create and maintain and imprint.
    9.  The Partner acknowledges and agrees that its Page(s) on the Website and App should not contain any contact details, direct references or links to the Partner or its website, app, platform, tool or other devices or to websites, apps, platforms, tools or other devices of third parties. The Partner must ensure that its trading identity and address are clearly visible to Customers in respect of all Treatwell Services used by them.
    10.  The Partner must at all times supply the Partner Services on the Website and App at a price which is accurate and conforms with the best available rate offered on the Partner’s own website. If a Customer provides proof of a better price available on the Partner’s own website for Partner Services booked through the Website, App or Widget, Treatwell reserves the right to refund the Customer the difference and to adjust the amount paid to the Partner in connection with those Partner Services accordingly. Different prices on a Partner’s website compared to that of the prices on the Website, App, or Widget would create a bad customer experience and is not in line with the Treatwell partnership. This could also lead to an unavoidable increase in Charges For the avoidance of doubt, the Partner is permitted to offer lower prices or special offers to closed groups of individuals, both online and offline, e.g. to members of its own loyalty scheme, or directly in the Partner’s venue, and also on other alternative online sales platforms. A breach of this clause 6.10 shall be a Material Breach of this Agreement.
    11.  The Partner must ensure that it has obtained the consent of each of its employees and contractors to be advertised on the Website and App to Customers including but not limited to details such as name, expertise, contact details, availability, services offered and photograph.
    12.  The Partner is solely responsible for ensuring that the information on Connect regarding time and date availability is kept completely up to date so that potential Customers are able to view the accurate time and date availability at the time of making a Booking.
    13.  In respect of Treatwell Bookings made using the “Pay at Venue” option, the Commission shall be payable for all such Treatwell Bookings except where a “no show” has been flagged by the Partner on Connect by midnight on the date of the appointment. For the avoidance of doubt, if a “no show” has not been flagged on Connect by midnight on the date of the appointment, the Treatwell Booking will be treated by Treatwell as fulfilled and Treatwell shall be entitled to receive Commission in respect of that Treatwell Booking.
    14.  The Partner shall not solicit Treatwell Customers or Widget Customers to make Bookings otherwise than through the Website, Distribution Channels or Widget (as applicable). Any solicitation could result in unavoidable increases in the Charges. As part of this Agreement and partnership, Treatwell markets and seeks to bring new Customers to a Partner. If a Partner encourages that Customer to cancel their Booking and rebook directly with the Partner, this means that the Partner has taken advantage of the Treatwell Services without paying for them, which is unfair on Treatwell both economically and commercially.
    15.  Where a Customer makes a Booking and the Partner encourages that Customer to cancel their Booking and make a separate booking directly with the Partner, the Partner shall be in Material Breach of this Agreement.
    16.  If Treatwell has reasonable grounds to suspect that the Partner has made or makes any direct or indirect attempt to avoid paying any Charges, for example without limitation, by fraudulently flagging a Fulfilled Booking using the “Pay at Venue” option as a “no show”, this shall be a Material Breach of this Agreement and shall give Treatwell the right, without limiting other remedies available to it, to withhold and retain any payments due to the Partner under this Agreement.
    17.  If the Partner is receiving any of the Treatwell Services as part of a Free Trial, the Partner must provide Treatwell with full payment details prior to the expiration of the Free Trial. Failure to do so will be a Material Breach of this Agreement.
    18.  If Treatwell has reasonable grounds to suspect that the Partner has made any direct or indirect attempt to avoid paying Charges which would otherwise become due at the end of the Free Trial, for example and without limitation, by signing up or attempting to sign up for continuous Free Trials by using alternative contact information or names or by any other means, this shall be a Material Breach of this Agreement and shall give Treatwell the right, without limiting other remedies available to it, to withhold and retain any payments due to the Partner under this Agreement.
7.  **Customer Service and Complaints**
    1.  The Partner shall use best endeavours to provide top quality Partner Services to all Customers and shall promptly deal with any sales enquiries, matters or issues relating to Bookings or potential Bookings including dealing with Customer complaints.
    2.  The Partner shall be directly responsible to the Customer for any failure to fulfil the Customer’s expectations or for any other legal liability which arises in respect of the Partner Services, save where such liability arises as a result of Treatwell’s negligence.
    3.  Treatwell shall refer any Customer complaints it receives to the Partner and the Partner shall acknowledge all complaints, and shall respond to the relevant Customer within 48 hours of the Partner’s receipt of a complaint (whether the complaint has come directly from the Customer or via Treatwell).
    4.  The Partner shall make all efforts to reach a resolution to any complaints within 14 days and must notify Treatwell of any correspondence between the Partner and the Customer relating to the complaint and generally keep Treatwell apprised of its progress and the status of the complaint.
    5.  The Partner hereby acknowledges and accepts that the Website and App includes a reviewing platform, upon which Customers may post publicly viewable reviews about their experiences with Treatwell and with the Partner (particularly in relation to the Partner Services) (**“User Generated Content”**) and that a selection of reviews from preceding months will also be made available on the Partner Site (if applicable). The Partner should note that this platform may not be opted out from and may from time to time contain negative reviews and/or feedback from Customers, which is outside Treatwell’s control. There is an option for the Partner, if they are the subject of any User Generated Content, to reply to reviews about them. However, any content the Partner posts in response to User Generated Content must be polite and professional and non-threatening or confrontational, and it may be subject to review by Treatwell (and may be removed or amended in Treatwell’s sole discretion if Treatwell deems it reasonably necessary to do so). For the avoidance of doubt, the Partner shall have no right to any remedy (including without limitation, any right to immediately terminate this Agreement) as a result of any User Generated Content naming or referring to the Partner. However, if the Partner, acting reasonably, feels that any User Generated Content is defamatory of the Partner or any person or in some other way is a violation of any person’s legal rights, the Partner may flag and report that User Generated Content to Treatwell. In such case, Treatwell shall review the same and in its sole discretion take any action it deems necessary or desirable (including, for example, removing or amending the relevant piece of User Generated Content). The Partner must only ever respond to a review via the review platform and must never contact or attempt to contact a customer in response to a review other than on the review platform, even where the Partner knows the identity of the customer who left the review or can determine the customer’s identity by some other means. Any breach of this clause 7.5 will be a Material Breach of this Agreement.
8.  **PARTNER COMPLAINTS**
    1.  If the Partner has a complaint about any Treatwell P2B Services, it should contact Treatwell via [Web form](https://partners.treatwell.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new "https://partners.treatwell.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new") the subject line ‘Formal Complaint’ (**“Complaint”**), providing as much detail as possible about the Complaint.
    2.  Treatwell shall respond to the Partner confirming receipt and will then investigate the matter.
    3.  Upon receiving the Complaint, Treatwell’s customer experience team, together with the account manager responsible for that Partner, shall work together to investigate the Complaint internally, taking into account the importance and complexity of the issue raised.
    4.  If the Complaint relates to a Partner’s account manager, another member of the supply team will help with the investigation in their place.
    5.  Treatwell shall respond to the Partner with its findings in response to the Complaint, and, where applicable, with a suggested solution.
    6.  If the Partner or Treatwell prefers at any time to refer any disputes to mediation, Treatwell is willing to engage with the following mediators [www.cedr.com/](https://www.cedr.com/ "https://www.cedr.com/") (but the Partner and Treatwell may agree on a different mediator jointly if they wish).
    7.  Any reports that Treatwell publishes in relation to Complaints made pursuant to this clause 8 will be available on the Website from July 2021 onwards.
9.  **Customer Data**
    1.  For the purposes of this clause, “data controller”, “data processor”, “data subject”, “personal data”, “process”, “processing” and “appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be interpreted in accordance with applicable Data Protection Legislation.
    2.  Treatwell and the Partner each acknowledge that, for the purposes of the Data Protection Legislation:

Partner shall provide full cooperation and prompt assistance to Treatwell in respect of its efforts to (i) investigate, remediate, and mitigate the effects of the Security Incident, and (ii) comply with notification obligations to individuals, clients or regulatory authorities;
        3.  Partner must not do, or omit to do, and must ensure that its personnel and other representatives do not do or omit to do, anything that would cause (or may be reasonably expected to cause) Treatwell or its Affiliates to be in breach of any provision of any Data Protection Legislation and take all reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of its employees, contractors and agents who may have access to the personal data and ensure that such staff and agents are informed of the confidential nature of the personal data and have undertaken training in the laws relating to handling personal data;
        4.  Partner agrees to implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures in respect of its processing of the personal data sufficient to comply with the Data Protection Legislation and to protect the personal data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damages, theft, alteration or disclosure;
        5.  Partner agrees to only process personal data of Treatwell Customers and Widget Customers for the purpose of providing the Partner Services to such Customers and, in the case of Treatwell Customers and Widget Customers who have expressly agreed by way of opt-in consent to receiving email marketing via the eCRM Service, for the purposes of email marketing and in all cases only whilst receiving the Treatwell Services; and
        6.  should Partner, its affiliates or its suppliers need to transfer the personal data of Treatwell Customers and/or Widget Customers to locations outside the European Economic Area, Partner takes full responsibility (and accepts full liability) for ensuring that such personal data is processed fully in compliance with Data Protection Legislation.
    4.  Where the Partner is data controller and Treatwell is data processor, in respect of Partner Customers’ personal data and PAV Widget Customers’ personal data (except in respect of email marketing of PAV Widget Customers where the Partner and Treatwell are independent data controllers), such personal data shall be processed by Treatwell in accordance with the obligations of Article 28 of the GDPR, subject to the provisions of clause 8.9 below and subject to Treatwell being able to charge the Partner for providing any assistance not expressly specified as a service requirement of Treatwell under this Agreement.
    5.  Treatwell reserves the right to process Customer personal data as set out in its Privacy and Cookie Policy currently here [here](https://www.treatwell.be/info/privacy-policy/) (as may be updated from time to time) and the Partner hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees and consents to the processing of such personal data by Treatwell and further warrants that each Partner Customer has been informed how Treatwell will process their personal data. Without limiting Partner’s obligations elsewhere in this Agreement, the Partner undertakes promptly to include any information reasonably requested by Treatwell in its website privacy policy or other Partner Customer literature to assist each party in compliance with Data Protection Legislation.
    6.  The Partner acknowledges that ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights in Treatwell Customer, Widget Customer and Partner Customer personal data in Connect shall vest in Treatwell or its Affiliates and Partner irrevocably and unconditionally assigns with full title guarantee all such rights to Treatwell. Treatwell grants the Partner a non-exclusive license to use such personal data to operate its business subject to Partner's ongoing compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.
    7.  Where the Partner is receiving the eCRM Service, the Partner may send marketing or promotional communications to Treatwell Customers and Widget Customers whose details are stored in Connect and who have given their consent via an ‘opt-in’ box on signing up to receive the Treatwell Services or when booking Partner Services via the Widget, to receive marketing or promotional communications from any Partner from whom they book Partner Services and/or specifically from the Partner with which they are booking.
    8.  The Partner warrants, represents and undertakes that it will only process the personal data of Partner Customers in compliance with Data Protection Legislation and in particular that it, its employees, its contractors, its partners and its suppliers will only send marketing or promotional communications to Partner Customers who have given their consent to receive the same. The Partner’s use of the personal data of Partner Customers is undertaken at the Partner’s sole risk with the Partner being responsible and liable for ensuring it, its employees’, its contractors’, its partners’ and its suppliers’ use fully complies with all applicable Data Protection Legislation.
    9.  In the event that a Customer notifies the Partner or one of its employees or contractors that it does not wish to receive further marketing materials from Treatwell and/or its Affiliates, the Partner shall promptly (and in any event no later than 48 (forty eight) hours from being so informed) notify Treatwell with full details of the same in writing so that Treatwell can honour such request.
    10.  In the event that a data subject makes a request to either party to exercise one or more of the rights afforded to data subjects under Data Protection Legislation then to the extent that either party reasonably requires input or assistance from the other party in order to give effect to any of the rights afforded, that other party shall provide all such input or assistance within a reasonable timeframe with each party meeting their own costs in doing so.
    11.  In the event that either party receives a request from a data protection authority for information relating to this Agreement or the relationship between the parties, that party shall promptly notify the other unless prohibited by law.
    12.  Any breach of this clause 8 by the Partner, or its employees, contractors or agents, will be a Material Breach of this Agreement.
    13.  The Partner will indemnify and hold Treatwell and its Affiliates harmless against all losses, claims, costs, damages or proceedings suffered or incurred by Treatwell and/or its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with the Partner's breach of this clause 8.
    14.  This clause 8 in its entirety shall survive the termination or expiry of this Agreement.
10.  **Partner Warranties and Indemnity**
    1.  The Partner shall provide Treatwell with any Partner Content it reasonably requires to be provided with in order to supply the Treatwell Services.
    2.  Partner hereby grants Treatwell a non-exclusive, royalty free, irrevocable and worldwide right and license (or sublicense as applicable) to use, reproduce, distribute, sublicense, communicate and make available the Partner Content on the Website, the App, , the Treatwell Lookbook, Treatwell’s social media pages and any and all other Distribution Channels, and for any other purposes which are necessary for Treatwell or required by Treatwell to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this Agreement,, and for any other reason, including but not limited to, marketing, advertising, commercial or editorial purposes..
    3.  Treatwell may sublicense, make available, disclose and/or offer the Partner Content to Affiliates and third parties (**“Third Party Platforms”**), including but not limited to Google via its services such as Reserve With Google and Google My Business. In no event shall Treatwell be liable to the Partner for any acts or omissions on the part of any Third Party Platforms. The sole remedy available to the Partner in respect of such Third Party Platforms is to (a) request Treatwell (which has the right and not the obligation) to disable and disconnect with such Third Party Platform in respect of the Partner; or (b) terminate this Agreement, in accordance with clause 11. Partner gives Treatwell full authority to set-up and manage the Partner Content on Partner’s Google My Business account as its authorised representative. If Partner wishes to regain exclusive control of its Google My Business account at any time, Partner should inform Treatwell and Treatwell will take the necessary steps to disassociate from the account and relinquish permissions to manage and change such account.
    4.  The Partner hereby grants Treatwell the right to:
        1.  remove, edit, cut-down or otherwise amend Partner Content published on on the Website, App, Widget, Distribution Channels, Partner Site and/or the Treatwell Lookbook, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation where such Partner Content does not, in Treatwell’s reasonable opinion, comply with the warranties at clause 9.5 or is otherwise in breach of the terms of this Agreement; and
        2.  make use of search engine optimisation services, pay-per-click advertising, and other mechanisms that embody, incorporate or quote (in whole or part) the trading name of the Partner or any brands used in connection with the Partner Services.
    5.  The Partner warrants, represents and undertakes that:
        1.  all Partner Content it supplies to Treatwell in connection with this Agreement and/or publishes (or provides to Treatwell for publication) on the Website, the App, the Widget, the Distribution Channels, the Partner Site and/or the Treatwell Lookbook, if applicable) will be accurate in all material respects and shall not infringe any other person’s rights (including Intellectual Property Rights) or be defamatory, unlawful, offensive, threatening, or pornographic or otherwise falling below general standards of taste and decency; and
        2.  it shall comply with all applicable laws and advertising regulations in the marketing, sale and provision of the Partner Services and shall obtain all licences, consents, authorities and insurance it is either necessary or reasonably prudent for the Partner to obtain in respect of all its business activities and personnel (but especially in connection with the provision of Partner Services). This includes ensuring that any prices listed as discount are genuine discounts, having been higher previously and only on discount for a short period as advertised.
    6.  Any breach of the warranties in clauses 9.5 will be a Material Breach of this Agreement.
    7.  The Partner hereby agrees to indemnify, keep indemnified and hold harmless Treatwell and its officers, directors and employees, from and against any and all claims, demands, obligations, actual or alleged causes of action and lawsuits and all damages, liabilities, fines, judgments, costs (including settlement costs), expenses associated therewith (including the payment of reasonable legal charges and disbursements) and losses (including but not limited to any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis)) and all other reasonable professional costs and expenses arising out of or in connection with any breach by the Partner of any term of this Agreement or arising out of any action brought by any third party relating to the Partner Services provided (or not provided), or actions (or failures to act), of the Partner or any person (other than Treatwell) acting on its behalf, including, without limitation any action brought in connection with any Data Protection Legislation, Partner Content or a Customer visit to the Partner's venue.
    8.  The Partner acknowledges that Treatwell enters into this Agreement for its own benefit but also as an agent for the benefit and on behalf of each of its officers, directors and employees (each an “Indemnified Third Party” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Third Parties”’) and that the rights in respect of indemnification set out in clause 9.7 shall be rights and benefits of each such Indemnified Third Party (as if, in each case, a party to this Agreement in its own right). Such rights shall be enforceable under this Agreement by Treatwell as agent for each such Indemnified Third Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partner and Treatwell may agree in writing to amend any provision of this Agreement without the consent of any of the Indemnified Third Parties, even if that amendment affects or will affect the rights conferred on any Indemnified Third Party hereunder.
    9.  This clause 9 shall survive the termination or expiry of this Agreement.
11.  **Payment Terms - For the avoidance of doubt, this is not a Treatwell P2B Service and therefore not subject to the P2B Regulation.**
    1.  Payment processing services for Partners are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe Services Agreement. By agreeing to these Partner Terms of Business and continuing to use the Treatwell Services, Partner agrees to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as may be modified by Stripe from time to time. Under no circumstances can the Stripe Services be used in violation of the Stripe Services Agreement and any failure to do so by a Partner will be a Material Breach of this Agreement. Subject to agreeing to the Stripe Services Agreement and to receiving approval from Stripe to become a Stripe Connected Account, the following additional terms must be adhered to by the Partner in order for Treatwell to enable the Stripe Services. A Partner cannot be a Stripe Connected Account without complying with these terms:
        1.  the Partner agrees to provide Treatwell with accurate and complete KYC information about its business and the ownership of its business and to update that information whenever necessary to ensure it is accurate at all times;
        2.  the Partner hereby authorises Treatwell to act on its behalf in setting up, creating and managing its Stripe Connected Account and any other activity required for the operation of the Stripe Connected Account and to receive notices from Stripe on its behalf, including but not limited to tax invoices;
        3.  the Partner hereby authorises Treatwell to access its Stripe Connected Account Data and to share the Stripe Connected Account Data with Stripe. Stripe and Treatwell are independently responsible for ensuring that Stripe Connected Account Data within their possession or control is protected from unauthorised disclosure; and
        4.  the Partner understands and acknowledges that if Treatwell suspects the Partner of any fraudulent, unlawful, deceptive or abusive activity, it is contractually required to inform Stripe promptly of this on becoming aware.
    2.  Treatwell will issue an invoice statement to the Partner twice a month (the **“Invoice Statement”**) which will set out, in the account summary at the top of the Invoice Statement (the **“Account Summary”**):
        1.  the balance carried over from the previous Invoice Statement, if any;
        2.  what Treatwell owes the Partner in respect of Fulfilled Bookings in the period since the last Invoice Statement;
        3.  what the Partner owes Treatwell in respect of Charges since the last Invoice Statement (e.g. Sign-Up Fee, Processing Fees and Commission etc.) (such amounts to be deducted from any amount owed at 10.2(b) above); and
        4.  the resulting account balance (the **“Closing Balance”**) payable either by Treatwell to the Partner or the Partner to Treatwell.
    3.  The Invoice Statement will also itemise all categories of Bookings and Charges including:
        1.  Fulfilled Bookings where the Customer prepays the total amount payable;
        2.  Fulfilled Bookings made using the “Pay at Venue” option;
        3.  Prepaid Widget Bookings;
        4.  Charges payable to Treatwell by the Partner which are not directly tied to a collection by Treatwell of payment for a specific Booking from a Customer (that is, where the Sign-Up Fee is due, or where such other Charges or amounts are from time to time payable by the Partner to Treatwell); and
        5.  Cancellations.
    4.  If the Closing Balance is negative, Treatwell will transfer the Closing Balance to the Partner within 3 to 5 Business Days of the date of the Invoice Statement (provided the Partner has provided their bank details to Treatwell) and no further action in respect of that Invoice Statement will be required by the Partner.
    5.  If the Closing Balance is positive, the Partner authorises Treatwell to send instructions on its behalf to the financial institution associated with its payment details (as entered in Connect), in order to take any payment due to Treatwell from the Partner pursuant to the Invoice Statement from the Partner’s account. In the event a Treatwell initiated payment fails, the Partner will be required to transfer the Closing Balance to Treatwell within 14 days of the date of the Invoice Statement to the account details listed in the Invoice Statement by whichever means the Partner chooses out of those made available by Treatwell at the relevant time and which may include any and all of bank transfer, credit card, direct debit mandate and/or recurring payment set-up. If the Partner has any concerns regarding the Invoice Statement or its ability to transfer the Closing Balance within the required timeframe, the Partner should contact Treatwell as soon as possible.
    6.  If the Closing Balance is zero, the Invoice Statement will state that the Closing Balance is settled and there is nothing further for Treatwell or the Partner to do in respect of that Invoice Statement.
    7.  In respect of Prepaid Widget Bookings and Treatwell Bookings, the following terms and conditions shall apply:
        1.  Treatwell receives pre-payments from Customers as the Partner's commercial agent and the Customer's debt to the Partner in respect of that shall be discharged when the pre-payment is received by Treatwell;
        2.  unless otherwise agreed in writing between Treatwell and the Partner, any onward payment of amounts collected by Treatwell and due to the Partner will be strictly subject to the Partner having provided the Partner Services pursuant to a Booking in accordance with this Agreement; and
        3.  subject to clause 10.7(b) above being satisfied by the Partner, onward payment of any Closing Balance will be payable by Treatwell or the Partner, as applicable, in accordance with clause 10.4 or 10.5 above.
    8.  The Partner shall make all payments due to Treatwell in accordance with clause 10.5 without any deduction whether by way of set-off, withholding, counterclaim, discount or otherwise. If any sum due from the Partner to Treatwell under these terms is not paid on or before the due date for payment, all sums owing by the Partner to Treatwell shall become due and payable immediately and without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Treatwell, Treatwell shall be entitled to:
        1.  suspend or terminate its provision of the Treatwell Services and this Agreement, including disabling the Partner’s listing on the Website and App, until arrangements as to payment or credit have been established which are satisfactory to Treatwell;
        2.  charge the Partner the cost of obtaining judgment or payment, to include all reasonable professional costs (including legal fees) and other costs of issuing proceedings or otherwise pursuing a debt recovery procedure; and
        3.  where the Partner has multiple venues with Treatwell, offset the sums due from Partner to Treatwell against payments due by Treatwell to the Partner in relation to those other venues.
    9.  The Partner shall be responsible for any refunds, chargebacks, banking charges or other administrative expenses (**“Bank Charges”**) incurred by Treatwell as a result of Partner’s failure to notify Treatwell in advance of changes in payment details and/or arrangements, including but not limited to:
        1.  bank account details;
        2.  cancellation of a direct debit mandate;
        3.  insufficient funds;
        4.  card expiry
    10.  Treatwell reserves the right to deduct any sums payable to Treatwell by the Partner and any such Bank Charges, from any balance collected by Treatwell on behalf of the Partner, prior to onward payment of any Closing Balance to the Partner.
    11.  All payments due from Treatwell to the Partner shall be made via bank transfer using the bank details provided by the Partner to Treatwell in Connect (and as set out in the Invoice Statement) and it is the Partner’s responsibility to ensure that these details are correct. Treatwell will only make payments due to the Partner directly to the Partner and cannot make payments to any third party. The Partner shall fully indemnify Treatwell and hold Treatwell harmless against any losses, damages or claims arising out of the Partner’s failure to notify Treatwell of a change of bank account details including but not limited to any Bank Charges incurred by Treatwell as a result.
    12.  Treatwell reserves the right to charge interest on all amounts payable to Treatwell from the Partner which are not paid by the relevant due date at the annual rate of 12%. Such interest will accrue on a daily basis from the date on which payment became overdue up to the date on which Treatwell receives the full outstanding amount together with all accrued interest.
    13.  In the event of a dispute between Treatwell and the Partner, any undisputed amount of Commission will be paid in accordance with this clause 10 to Treatwell. The Partner must notify Treatwell of its disagreement within 14 days of receipt of the Invoice Statement setting out in detail the reason. If the Partner fails to do so, the Invoice Statement shall be deemed accepted by the Partner. For the avoidance of doubt, this is a separate process from the Partner complaints process as set out in Clause 9, and these terms on Commission payment apply whether or not the Partner raises any Complaint and regardless of the outcome of any Complaint.
    14.  The Partner is responsible for withholding and reporting taxes applicable to the Commission in accordance with all applicable laws and the requests of the relevant tax authorities, including for any interest and penalties imposed for late payment or failure to withhold. If required, the Partner shall be solely responsible for agreeing with the relevant tax authorities on the tax treatment of the Commission. The Partner shall on the request of Treatwell provide copies of tax payment certificates and/or tax exemption certificates. The Partner represents and warrants that it is duly registered with all relevant tax authorities, where applicable.
    15.  The Partner understands and acknowledges that Treatwell is a commercial booking agent and does not provide the Partner Services to the Customer. The contract for the Partner Services is between the Partner and the Treatwell Customer and as a result, it is the Partner’s responsibility, if the Partner is VAT registered, to charge VAT on the total value of the Booking and to provide a VAT receipt to the Customer, if requested. Treatwell Services are subject to the reverse charge rule. VAT has to be accounted for by the recipient as per Article 196 Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
    16.  In the event of fraudulent or alleged fraudulent activities by the Partner or if Treatwell is required by law, court order, governmental instruction, arbitrational decision or by its cancellation policy to make a refund, of all or part of a Booking, Treatwell reserves the right to claim repayment from the Partner of any amount required to be repaid by Treatwell to the Customer and for any Bank Charges relating thereto.
    17.  Any breach of this clause 10 by the Partner will be a Material Breach of this Agreement.
12.  **Term of the Agreement**

    7.  Treatwell shall be entitled to temporarily freeze the account of any Partner, so that the Partner will be unable to receive Bookings via Treatwell and will not be visible on the Website, App, Widget or any Distribution Channels including in search results, if the Partner commits, or is suspected of committing, a Material Breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement (including but not limited to a breach of 6.1 (paying Charges and accepting Bookings) 6.1, 6.2 (only declining Bookings in exceptional circumstances), 6.5 (ensuring accuracy of Partner Content), 6.6 (consent for Stylist Portfolio Photos) , 6.10 (price parity) , 6.15 (non-solicitation of Customers) , 6.16 (avoiding Charges), 6.17 (payment details after free trial), 6.18 (avoiding Charges at the end of free trial), 8.5 (proper use of reviews platform) 10 (Customer Data), 11.5 (Partner Content consents), and 12 (Payment Terms)) or if Treatwell is investigating a possible Imperative Reason for termination.

    9.  In addition to the above and for the avoidance of doubt, clauses 11.3 and 12.8(a) also detail times where the Partner or Treatwell may terminate this Agreement.
    10.  Termination of this Agreement, however arising, shall not affect any of the parties’ rights and remedies that have accrued as at termination.
    11.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Partner shall no longer have access to Connect. The Partner should download any data or information stored in Connect in advance of termination. If the Partner was not able to do so and would like to access any of their data from Connect, they should reach out to their account manager, who will arrange for this to be encrypted and sent to the Partner via email to the extent legally and practically possible.
13.  **Confidentiality**
    1.  Each party acknowledges that, whether by virtue of and in the course of this Agreement or otherwise, it may receive or otherwise become aware of information relating to the other party, their marketing plans, their clients, customers, businesses, business plans, finances, technology or affairs, which is proprietary and confidential to the other party (**“Confidential Information”**).
    2.  Each party undertakes to maintain and procure the maintenance of the confidentiality of Confidential Information at all times and to keep and procure the keeping of all Confidential Information secure and protected against theft, damage, loss or unauthorised access, and not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or at any time thereafter, without the prior written consent of the owner of the Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, use, disclose, exploit, copy or modify any Confidential Information, or authorise or permit any third party to do the same, other than for the sole purpose of the performance of its rights and obligations hereunder.
    3.  The terms of and obligations imposed by this clause 12 shall not apply to any Confidential Information which:
        1.  at the time of receipt by the recipient is in the public domain;
        2.  subsequently comes into the public domain through no fault of the recipient, its officers, employees or agents;
        3.  is lawfully received by the recipient from a third party on an unrestricted basis; or
        4.  is already known to the recipient before receipt hereunder.
    4.  The recipient may disclose Confidential Information in confidence to a professional adviser of the recipient or if it is required to do so by law, regulation or order of a competent authority.
    5.  This clause 12 shall survive the termination or expiry of this Agreement.
14.  **Liability**
    1.  Subject to clause 13.2, Treatwell’s maximum aggregate liability under or in connection with this Agreement, or any related contract, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, shall in no circumstances exceed the Charges due and payable to Treatwell hereunder on the date of the event giving rise to the relevant claim. Further, Treatwell shall not be liable for any loss of income or profits, loss of contracts, goodwill, or other intangible losses or for any indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind howsoever arising and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise (even if Treatwell has been advised by the Partner of the possibility of such loss or damage).
    2.  Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or in any way limit Treatwell’s liability for fraud or for death or personal injury caused by its negligence or for its wilful default or any other liability to the extent the same may not be excluded or limited as a matter of law.
    3.  This clause 13 in its entirety shall survive the termination or expiry of this Agreement.
15.  **RANKING**
    1.  There are parameters which determine the ranking of listings made available to Customers via the App and/or Website. The order in which a Partner’s listing is shown in the search results, when a Customer searches for Partner Services on the App and/or Website depends on a number of parameters, the main ones of which are:
        1.  how new the listing is (newer listings are ranked higher);
        2.  how many reviews it has received (fewer reviews may mean lower ranking), the recency of these reviews (more recent reviews may mean higher ranking) and how highly the reviews rate the Partner (negative reviews may result in lower ranking);
        3.  the search parameters included by the Customer and the Partner's availability and ability to fulfil the criteria searched for (e.g. time and date of appointment or location; where a Partner does not have a lot of availability at times requested by the Customer, that Partner will not be seen as high in the search results order as in other searches);
        4.  the reliability of a Partner based on the number of Partner led cancellations or reschedules of Bookings or lack of responsiveness to Customer order confirmations (each of which will lead to a lower ranking); and
        5.  the Customer's location if the Customer has enabled location sharing with Treatwell via the App or their browser (Partners who are closer to the Customer’s location will have their listings ranked higher in the search results).  
            These parameters are used because they give Customers a fair indication of other Customers’ experiences and the Partner Services which are available and convenient to them, and allow a Customer to see both new listings, the most recommended listings (based on Customer reviews) and any Partner who has the most appropriate availability and reliability.  
              
            
    2.  Customers can also alter the search results and ranking by sorting a search by ‘Recommended’, ‘Highest Rated’, ‘Price’ or ‘Discount’:
        1.  Where a Customer searches by ‘Recommended’, the order that a Partner will be shown will be based on a combination of the availability of a Partner at times requested by the Customer, the location and their reviews;
        2.  Where a Customer searches by ‘Highest Rated’ the order that a Partner will be shown will be based on the number of reviews that they have received, the recency of those reviews and how high those reviews are.  
            If a Customer does not sort the search results by the categories listed in this clause 16.2, ranking will be based on the parameters listed in clause 16.1.  
              
            
    3.  Partners may access Customer ratings and reviews of their Partner Services by visiting the Website or App or through Connect, but Partners have no rights in or to such reviews, and are not entitled to copies of such reviews upon any termination of the Partner's account and/or Treatwell Services.
    4.  Treatwell does not receive any direct or indirect remuneration or equivalent from any Partner in order to boost its rankings in search results.
