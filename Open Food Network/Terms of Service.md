Open Food Network: Terms of Service



This Agreement governs your use of the Open Food Network website at www.openfoodnetwork.org.au

and all content, services and products available at or through the website, which we collectively refer to

as "the Service".



The Service is made available to you in consideration for you agreeing to comply with this Agreement,

including any variation, amendment or replacement Agreement.



A reference to "we", "us", "our" or "Open Food Foundation" is a reference to Open Food Web

Foundation Ltd.



To use the Service, you need to agree to the terms in this Agreement. This Agreement comprises the

terms below, this preamble, and with all other policies we publish (including, but not limited to, the

Open Food Network Privacy Policy, API and Data Use Policy, Copyright Infringement Policy and

Community Guidelines).



Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Service. By accessing or using any

part of the Service, you agree that you are bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you

do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then you may not access the Service.



We are currently in a Limited Beta “trial” phase. These Terms of Service will be updated at the end of

this phase.



If you've got any questions, feel free to ask us hello@openfoodnetwork.org and we'll do our best to

answer.

0. Purpose



The purpose of Open Food Web Foundation (“Purpose”) are to accumulate and protect a commons

(“the open food web”) of open source knowledge, code, applications and platforms to support the

proliferation of fair and sustainable food systems.



We will apply the terms of this Agreement in a way consistent with our Purpose. If there is a clear

inconsistency between a term in this Agreement (or part of a term) and our Purpose, the term (or part of

the term) will override the Purpose.



You are expected to use the Service and act in a way consistent with our Purpose.

1\. Your Account



If you create an account on the Service, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your

account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under the account. You must take reasonable

steps to guard the security of your account. You agree to keep your login credentials secure and

confidential. We will not be liable for anything that happens if your account security is breached as a

result of your failure to protect it.

2\. Account Structure



In the limited beta “trial” phase, the Service has two types of public accounts, an “Enterprise Trial User

Account” and a “Customer Trial User Account”. There are no fees associated with these types of

account.

As the holder of an “Enterprise Trial User Account”, you warrant that you have the authority to act on

behalf of the Enterprise identified in that account.



All account holders (whether Enterprise Trial User Account, Customer Trial User Account or another

kind of account) are encouraged to actively participate in the Open Food Network Community. Open

Food Network is a community by and for food buyers/sellers. Together, we are building a website

where we can share our experience and knowledge. For Open Food Network to thrive, we need people

to share their knowledge, experience and needs, and help build the site itself.



Active participation in the Open Food Network Community is demonstrated through, but not limited

to, the following channels:



- a user account with the Open Food Foundation website and participation in discussions;

- logging of problems on bugherd;

- response to feedback requests; and

- participation in face to face discussions with other members of the community.



Post limited beta phase, the Open Food Network will have different accounts and associated fee

structure.



Post limited beta phase, your contributions will be taken into account through waiver of future

payment, at our discretion.



3\. Content policy



Our content policy relates to any material you may post on the Open Food Network website or through

the Service, which we call "Content". This includes profile information and any other material, whether

text, graphics, or any other format, which you may post on Open Food Network itself or link to from

Open Food Network.



All Content posted to the Service is your responsibility. If we reasonably consider that Content might

be illegal or unlawful by any law having jurisdiction over you, you agree that we may submit any

information to any relevant authority or person and we have your consent to do so. We claim no

ownership or control over any Content that you post to the Service. You retain any intellectual property

rights to the Content you post, in accordance with applicable law. By posting Content, you represent

that you have the rights to reproduce that Content (and the right to allow us to serve such Content)

without violation of the rights of any third party. You agree that you will bear any liability resulting

from the posting of any Content that you do not have the rights to post and that you will indemnify us

in respect of any breach of this clause 3.



You grant us a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and

publish the Content, solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting the contents of

your account, through any part of the Service including through our API, feeds, and external clients.

Each time you post Content to the Service, you represent that our use of the Content consistent with

that licence will not cause us to breach any laws or infringe any person’s intellectual property. If you

delete Content, we will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Service, but you acknowledge that

caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.



3.1 Structured Data



There is a subset of Content that we refer to as "Structured Data". Structured Data is Content that

represents simple facts, rather than creative effort. For instance, locations, dates, or the type and

number of products you have listed. Structured Data may be created explicitly by you or implicitly by

the Website in response to your activity. You acknowledge that you have no copyright or moral rights

in Structured Data.



By using the Service, you acknowledge that Structured Data will be compiled and stored by us, and

that any Structured Data pertaining to you or your activity may be made available for use by third

parties under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license. You also agree

to Open Food Foundation.

payment methods. As an Enterprise, your account will contain information about your customers etc.

We encourage Enterprises to exercise care and comply with behaviour outlined in this Agreement and

Privacy Policy, but we are not responsible or liable for how Enterprises use their Customers’ data.



As Enterprises, you will put information into the system relating to your payment methods etc. Aside

from what you put in publicly viewable fields, this information will not be available to any other users,

or passed on by us to any other party.



Your Enterprise data can be extracted from the site via csv

responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to an external website or webpage, we do not

represent or imply that we endorse such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking

precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan

horses, and other harmful or destructive content. We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting

from your use of external websites and webpages, whether that link is provided by us or by any

provider of Content on the Service.



3.4 How we deal with problem Content

objectionable.

obligation), in our sole discretion, to remove or refuse to remove any content from the Service. If such

content is reported to us, it will be our sole discretion as to what action, if any, should be taken. If we

receive notification of an alleged infringement of copyright, we will follow Attachment 3: Copyright

Attachment 1: Open Food Network

Community Guidelines



Open Food Network is a community by and for food buyers/sellers. Together, we are building a

website where we can share our experience and knowledge. For Open Food Network to thrive, we

need people to share their knowledge, experience and needs, and help build the site itself.



Whatever your interest in Open Food Network you are welcome here, and will be treated with respect.

In particular:



• We welcome people of any age, gender identity or expression, ethnicity, nationality, religion

or absence thereof, political opinion, sexual orientation, marital status, family structure, ability

or disability, appearance, subculture, or other identity or self-identification.

• We welcome people of all skill and experience levels, and we don't believe in being

dismissive or commenting rudely just because you are new or learning.

• Every role in our community is important, including food producers and traders who

contribute skills, knowledge, and information to our site; coders, designers and other techies

who help build it; moderators and others who help our community thrive; or any other form of

participation. We believe in working together, and prioritise communication and mutual

understanding.



If you want to participate in the Open Food Network community (which includes our website and any

auxiliary forums such as our mailing list(s) etc), you need to agree to our general commitment to

inclusiveness and mutual respect, as well as to the following specific policies:



• Harassment of any Open Food Network community member is forbidden. Harassment

includes slurs directed at individuals or groups; unwanted sexual remarks directed at any

person or group; sexually explicit comments or imagery in public spaces; stalking or other

repeated, unwanted contact; or any repeated or sustained behaviour which disrupts someone

else's enjoyment of the Open Food Network site or community.

• The privacy of our community members is very important. You may not disclose any

member's personal details (including names by which they are known outside of Open Food

Network, their location, employment details, family details, outside-of-Open Food Network

contact details, or any other identifying or personal information) without their explicit

consent.

• Although we let you choose your own name on our site, and don't insist that you use the same

name on our website as you have on the cards in your wallet, you're not allowed to create or

use a pseudonymous account to mislead people, evade accountability, or otherwise cause

trouble. (This is commonly known as a "sockpuppet" account.)



If you experience or witness behaviour that goes against these community guidelines, you can report it

to hello@openfoodnetwork.org. We will listen carefully and take your report seriously. Once we've

looked into the situation, we may take any action we deem necessary. For instance, we may issue a

warning, or in serious cases we may suspend or ban people from our community. If this happens, we

will always tell the person affected the reason for our action, with reference to our policy documents.

Attachment 2: Privacy Policy



We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with privacy legislation and best practice

in this closed beta trial period. We are currently developing a privacy policy to be launched with beta

Open Food Network service in Australia in late 2014.

Attachment 3: Copyright Infringement

Policy



We hate legalese, so we've tried to make this policy readable. If you've got any questions, feel free to

ask us, and we'll do our best to answer.



This Copyright Infringement Policy covers all websites (such as vic.openfoodnetwork.org) owned and

operated by Open Food Foundation ("Open Food Foundation", "we", "us", "our") and all associated

services, collectively referred to as "the Service". It describes how you may report a violation of

copyright on the Service.



Open Food Foundation respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same.

Open Food Foundation members are required by the Terms of Service to ensure that they have the

legal right to post content to the Service.



Open Food Foundation is based in Melbourne, Australia and is not subject to the provisions of the

United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). However, we have established policy and

procedures which are similar to those required by the DMCA, as we believe they constitute best

practice for web services operating in Australia.



For the purposes of this Copyright Infringement Policy, “Intellectual Property Rights” include all

current and future intellectual property rights, whether registered or unregistered (and including any

application), including copyright, know-how, confidential information, trade secrets, business names

and domain names, trade marks, trade names, patents, petty patents, utility models, design rights,

database rights and all rights in the nature of unfair competition or rights to sue for passing off.

1\. Notifying us of an infringement



If you believe that a Open Food Network member has infringed your Intellectual Property Rights by

posting Content to the service, you may follow these steps to notify us and ask for the removal of the

Content.



Notifications may be submitted by email to hello@openfoodnetwork.org or by physical mail to:

Open Food Foundation

Level 3, 673 Bourke Street

Melbourne VIC 3000

AUSTRALIA



We prefer to receive notifications by email.



Copyright infringement notifications sent through any other mechanism or forum will not be acted

upon.



You must provide the following information:



• Sufficient information to identify the copyrighted work being infringed. For instance, if the

work is a published book, provide the title, author, and ISBN; if the work is a magazine

article, provide the title, author, magazine name, and magazine issue; if the work is available

on the Internet, provide the URL of the work.

• The URL of the specific page on Open Food Network where your work was reproduced

without permission. General descriptions or non-specific links (such as to Open Food

Network's homepage) cannot be acted upon.

• Your postal address, telephone number, and email address.

• A statement by you that the above information is accurate and that you are the copyright or

intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property

owner's behalf.

• A physical signature or digital signature in a recognized industry-standard format such as

PGP, of the copyright or intellectual property owner or the person authorized to act on their

behalf. Unsigned notifications will not be processed.

2\. Responding to notifications



We will respond to copyright infringement notifications within two business days.



If we are not provided with enough information to act on the notification, including all the items listed

in the section above, we will reject the notification and notify the submitter that it cannot be acted

upon.



If the Content is not hosted on our servers (for instance, if the notification concerns an image hosted on

another site which is merely displayed on or linked from our site) we will respond, notifying the

submitter that the Content is not hosted by us and referring them to the hosting site.



Provided we are able to act upon the notification, we will contact the member who posted the Content

and inform them of the notification and claim of Intellectual Property Rights.



The member will have two business days to respond. They may respond as follows:



• Admit that they have posted something to which they do not hold Intellectual Property Rights.

In this case, the member may delete the Content from the Service, or we may render it

inaccessible.

• Submit a counter-notification, stating that they have the right to post the Content, and that

they are prepared to uphold this claim in court. The process for this is outlined below.

• Respond saying that they do not believe they have infringed any Intellectual Property Rights,

but that they do not wish to formally submit a counter-notification. In this case, the member

may delete the Content from the Service, or we may render the Content inaccessible.

• If the member fails to respond, we will render the Content inaccessible.



When Content is deleted or rendered inaccessible, we will take reasonable efforts to ensure it cannot be

accessed via the Service. However, caching or external references may mean that Content remains

accessible for some time, including on third-party sites or applications. Third party sites and

applications are not under our control. If infringing Content has been removed or rendered inaccessible

via the Service but is still available via third-party sites and applications, the copyright or intellectual

property holder may contact the operators of those sites/applications to notify them of the infringement.

3\. Counter-notification and restoration process



A counter-notification is a statement that you do not believe your content infringes on another person's

Intellectual Property Rights, or that your use of another person's copyrighted material falls into a

protected category under law.



By filing a counter-notification, you are indicating that you are willing to defend your use of the

material in court, if the copyright owner chooses to bring a lawsuit against you for your use of the

material. This may involve civil and/or criminal penalties. We strongly suggest you contact an

intellectual property lawyer licensed to practice law in your jurisdiction before you do this, so that you

are aware of your rights and obligations under the law.



A counter-notification must contain the following items:



• Your signature. Signatures may be a physical signature or a digital signature in a recognized

industry-standard format such as PGP.

• The URL of the Content that has been called into question (this will have been provided in the

original notification).

• A statement that you have a good faith belief that the copyright infringement notification was

sent as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material. This should include any reasons

why you believe your use of the material is not infringing.

• Your name, address, and telephone number.



We will forward your counter-notification, in full, to the submitter of the original notification. They

will then have 14 days to initiate legal action and notify us that they have done so.



In the meantime, we will render the Content inaccessible.



If, after 14 days, we have not been informed that legal proceedings have been initiated, we will restore

the Content.



If you have filed a counter-notification, you may not re-post the allegedly-infringing material until we

notify you that the waiting period has expired.

4\. Repeat offenses



Members who receive three or more valid copyright infringement notices will have their accounts

terminated.



If a counter-notification is filed, or if the member has stated that they do not accept the allegation of

copyright infringement but do not wish to formally file a counter-notification, the notification will not

be counted toward termination.



We also reserve the right to terminate the accounts of those who, in our opinion, misuse or abuse the

copyright infringement notification process against other members.

5\. Changes



We may change our Copyright Infringement Policy from time to time. A history of changes to this

Policy is available via our public source code repository github. We will take reasonable steps to

notify you of any substantial changes to this Policy; however, it is your responsibility to check this

Policy periodically for changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy

will constitute your acceptance of such change.
