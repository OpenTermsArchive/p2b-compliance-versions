--------------------

### Introduction

Our mission is to connect the world’s professionals to enable them to be more productive and successful. LinkedIn Pages (“**Business Services**”) are designed to help organizations be found by customers, partners, employment candidates and others and to provide these organizations the chance to connect and to provide valuable information to LinkedIn members. [Learn More about LinkedIn Pages](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/linkedin-pages). 

### 1\. Contract

By creating, becoming an Administrator (as defined below), or continuing as an Administrator of a page (the “**Page**”) on our Business Services, you are agreeing to enter into legally binding contract terms between LinkedIn (as defined below and also referred to as “**we**”,“**us**” and “**our**” ) and your Organization (as defined below) represented by the Page. “**Organization**” means the business represented by your Page, which may only be a legal entity (such as a university or company) or you, if you are operating the business in your individual capacity (such as a sole proprietorship). You also represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into these contract terms on behalf of the Organization (collectively with the Organization, you and the other Administrators, if any, “**You**”).

If You do not agree to this contract (the “**Contract**” or “**Service Terms**”), do not register as an Administrator and do not access or otherwise use any of our Business Services (including creating, claiming or continuing as an Administrator for the Page). 

In addition to the Service Terms, the [LinkedIn User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement), [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) and [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy) apply to any use of our services. Additional terms may apply to specific features. For example, if You purchase premium features for the Page, such features may be subject to additional terms and payment obligations.

### 2. Obligations

You agree to only use the Business Services in accordance with these Service Terms.

2.1    Administrators. “**Administrator(s)**” are Member(s) who have signed up on the Business Services to be (or who were added as) “administrators” of the Page. [Learn More about Administrators](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/4783/linkedin-page-administrators-overview?lang=en). You acknowledge and agree that: 

* The Page must have at least one Administrator identified for the Page. 
* Each Administrator of the Page must be a current registered member of LinkedIn.com (“**Member**”) with correct contact information.

2.2    Name Changes and Mergers.  Subject to Section 4, You agree to accurately reflect the identity of the Organization on the Page and to promptly update any name changes of the Organization, including any that may result from mergers, acquisitions or other restructuring. Please [Contact Us](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/cp-master) with requests related to the Page.

2.3    Content and Conduct. You agree that:

* You will follow our “[Do’s and Don’ts](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#dos),” and keep content professional, respectful, relevant, and accurate.

2.4    Compliance with Data Policies. 

As with our other LinkedIn services, our collection, use and sharing of Your personal data is subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) (which includes our [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy) and other documents referenced in the Privacy Policy) and updates. You agree that You will comply with the Service Terms when collecting, using or otherwise processing any personal data related to Members. If You process data about Members (obtained either directly from LinkedIn services, from any third party application that has integrated with LinkedIn's APIs, or otherwise), You must ensure that You have a legal basis for doing so and that Your processing is in compliance with applicable laws (including by clearly informing the Members about Your processing and obtaining their unambiguous consent where necessary). You are responsible for Your and Your agents’ processing of this data, including with respect to any secondary uses, disclosures or transfers of the data.

2.5    Company Page Insights. The provision of information available to Administrators under the Page Analytics tab (“**Page Insights**”), if any, is subject to our [Page Insights Joint Controller Addendum](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/page-joint-controller-addendum) (the “**Addendum**”), which forms part of these Service Terms.

2.6  Lead Gen Forms on Pages. If you use the Page feature that allows LinkedIn members to submit their contact and other information to you ("**Lead Gen Forms on Pages**"), you must include a link to your privacy policy in each such form. You may only use the data submitted to you through Lead Gen Forms on Pages (“**Form Data**”) for lawful purposes agreed to by the registered LinkedIn members. Any custom questions in your registration form may not request sensitive data, including data revealing an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership; data concerning health or sexual orientation; data relating to criminal offenses; government-issued IDs; logins and passwords; financial account information; and information regarding minors under the age of 16. 

LinkedIn has the right, at its discretion, to refuse any custom question. The Form Data generally will be available to you or an authorized third party through LinkedIn for 90 days, and you or such third party are responsible for promptly obtaining a copy of and storing the Form Data on your behalf.

Subject to your privacy policy linked to the Lead Gen Forms on Pages, the reasonable privacy expectations of the registered LinkedIn members, applicable laws, these Terms and the scope of any consents obtained through the Lead Gen Forms on Pages, you may: (a) use Form Data and (b) share Form Data only with a third party acting on your behalf, such as your service provider, provided that you are responsible for ensuring their respective compliance with these Service Terms and for limiting their respective use of Form Data on your behalf. You may not: (i) sell Form Data under any circumstances or (ii) use Form Data in any unlawful manner (e.g., unlawful discrimination). If any LinkedIn member requests to opt-out of your communications or have his or her Form Data deleted, you will honor such request promptly.

### 3\. Intellectual Property

3.1    License. You grant to LinkedIn (and its affiliates) a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use, copy, modify, distribute and publish any content You provide to LinkedIn. The foregoing license survives termination of this Contract with regard to content provided prior to termination. You represent and warrant that you own or have all necessary rights (including intellectual property rights) to such content (including to grant the license above).

3.2   Feedback and Reservations of Rights. If You choose to provide suggestions and feedback to LinkedIn, You agree that LinkedIn (and its affiliates) can (but does not have to) use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensation to You. You may not disclose any information about our metrics or Member demographics. LinkedIn (and its affiliates) reserve all of our intellectual property rights in the Business Services.

### 4. Page Service Limits

You acknowledge and agree that:

* Any Administrator’s identity and actions related to the Page may be visible to others, including visitors and other Administrators of the Page.
* We may add or suspend any Administrator’s access to the Business Services (including administration of the Page) at any time at our own discretion.
* We may change or discontinue any of our services, including Business Services. In addition, LinkedIn reserves the right to remove any Page on the Business Services at any time without notice, including all, or part of, the Page’s content.
* We may modify the Page in accordance with our policies. For example, we may modify the Organization name on the Page and add clarification statements to the Page to address member confusion or conflicting trademark rights. In addition, we may (a) restrict any name change and have no obligations to perform any change, merger or other request, and (b) determine how name changes will be represented on profiles and on other references to the Organization on LinkedIn services.
* We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Business Services (or other services) and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain information or content in certain countries.
* We do not promise to store or keep showing any information and content that You have posted. We have no obligation to store, maintain or provide You a copy of any content or information that You or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable laws and as noted in our Privacy Policy.

### 5. Modification and Termination

5.1    Modification of Contract. We may modify this Contract from time to time. If we make material changes to the Contract, we will attempt to provide You notice through our Business Services (or by other means) to provide You the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If You object to any changes, You may terminate Your agreement to this Contract (in accordance with Section 5.2); however if You do not terminate Your agreement to this Contract, Your continued use of our Business Services after we publish or otherwise notify You about our changes to these terms means that You are consenting to the updated terms.

5.2    Termination of Contract. If You wish to terminate this Contract, at any time You can do so by (1) removing all Administrators of the Page, including Yourself (and others, if applicable); (2) deactivating the Page; (3) if you are the only Administrator, closing your LinkedIn account; and/or (4) notifying LinkedIn through [Contact Us](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/cp-master). LinkedIn has no obligation to de-activate the Page (even after termination). LinkedIn may terminate this Contract by de-activating the Page and/or by providing notice to at least one Administrator or otherwise to the Organization. Sections 2.4-10 survive termination.

If the Contract is translated into a language other than English, the translation is for convenience only, and the English language version will govern. LinkedIn may remotely monitor Your use of the Business Services to ensure compliance with the Contract. If any provision of the Contract is unenforceable, that provision will be modified to render it enforceable to the extent possible to give effect to the parties’ intentions and the remaining provisions will not be affected.
