What are the main ranking parameters?
=====================================

**Distance**: The most important ranking factor is distance. At Lieferando.de we prioritise places that are closest to the delivery address to spread the orders on our platform as much as possible between the active restaurants and stores. We also want to ensure a customer's waiting time is short and couriers only need to travel a few kilometres when delivering orders. When \`Collection' is selected instead of \`Delivery', we rank all restaurants and stores based on distance in the default listing.  
  
**Quality**: The quality score is a measurement based on our customers' average feedback via their most recent order and delivery ratings. This way, it shows a fair image of the delivered quality because Lieferando.de has millions of customers, all with different preferences. Please note that the content or characteristics of a restaurant's or store's range or products will on its own not have an effect on its position on the platform, but could in turn impact the quality score due to better reviews.  
  
**Popularity**: We determine popularity by the number of recent orders processed by a business compared to other businesses in that area. While this mainly applies to chain restaurants, it could also apply to more prominent restaurants or stores in a city centre. \`Popular places' also tend to employ more delivery staff and therefore can typically cover a larger delivery area and more orders. Based on their popularity, we place them somewhat higher on the list than restaurants or stores that do not have this kind of capacity.  
  
**New restaurants**: New businesses temporarily receive an improved position on Lieferando.de because they have fewer reviews. To help these places get started, they receive a higher placement for a short period of time (usually for a week). We indicate new businesses with the \`New' label.  
  
**Logistic efficiency**: Lieferando.de may temporarily move restaurants or stores down the list if we know that their orders are unlikely to be delivered to customers within a reasonable timeframe due to capacity issues at the business or our delivery services. In addition, both Lieferando.de and the restaurant or store can decide to "close" a business on the platform if it is too busy in which case it will no longer appear in the business list. For chains with multiple restaurants or stores that deliver to a customer's location we show the closest open branch first and move the further away chains down the list.  
  
**Sponsored Results**: Lieferando.de offers a paid sponsorship service, allowing businesses to improve their visibility on the platform by moving up their rank in the 'Best match' search results. This improved visibility is in proportion to the ranking they would otherwise have on Lieferando.de based on the ranking factors listed above.  
  
For example, a quality 4-star restaurant or store could appear below a 3-star if the customer is further away, so that place may wish to boost its visibility. It is also possible that a restaurant or store may want more orders on a certain day of the week, and uses the sponsorship services to increase orders for that day.  
  
While our sponsorship services are important tools for businesses, relevance to customers continues to be one of the main aims behind our ranking. To ensure that the results remain relevant to customers, restaurants and stores have limitations on improving their visibility. For example, it will be too costly for business #150 in an outer suburb to use our sponsored service and obtain the number 1 position for the entire city.  
  
We also restrict the number of spots a place can move up the list to ensure that even when restaurants or stores are using our sponsored services, customers feedback will always directly influence their position in the business list. We want to reward restaurants and stores that provide excellent service to customers while offering customers the best ordering experience possible.

  
**Favourites**: Customers have the possibility to save places as a \`Favourite'. These places will appear higher up in the business list in order for customers to find them more easily.  

**Other factors**: Furthermore, if any filtering, sorting, or searching actions have been taken, this will affect the order and types of restaurants and stores shown based on the eligibility of those restaurants and stores to the filtering, sorting, or searching criteria.

  
**Testing**: From time to time, we may run tests or experiments to monitor and improve our service, which may temporarily impact the restaurant or store order.Â
