Täuschung); (v) in case an express guarantee (Garantie) was taken over by a party; or (vi) all other

cases of statutory liability which (in each case) cannot lawfully be limited or excluded.

12.2. In case of slight negligence (einfache Fahrlässigkeit) we are liable to you only for breaches of

so-called cardinal obligations (Kardinalpflichten). Cardinal obligations are such obligations which

make the orderly fulfilment of an agreement like this Agreement possible and whose observance the

other party relies or may rely on. In such case our liability to you is limited to the typical, foreseeable

damage (typischer, vorhersehbarer Schaden). Insofar as our liability is limited or excluded according

to this clause 12.2, this also applies to the personal liability our legal representatives, employees,

and agents.

12.3. Except as set out in Clause 12.1 and Clause 12.2 above, our liability to you - for whatever legal

reason, in particular for defect, lack of rights and / or breach of other obligations under this

Agreement or for a pre-contractual obligation (e.g. as per Article 311 Abs. 2 BGB) or tort - shall be

excluded. This exclusion shall also apply to the personal liability of our legal representatives,

employees, and agents.

12.4. You will compensate us in full against any charges (including Chargebacks), losses, damages or

claims (and all related costs, (including legal fees), penalties, interest, expenses and other liabilities

incurred by us in connection with a breach by you of this Agreement. In addition, you will

compensate us and our Affiliates in full against any losses, damages, or claims (and all related costs,

including legal fees), penalties, interest, expenses and other liabilities resulting from a third party

claim against us or any of our Affiliates arising from our relationship with you as a Restaurant Partner



Version 1.1 07-20-2022 11

(whether or not in the fulfilment of either party’s obligations under this Agreement). You will also

compensate us and our Affiliates for any loss, damages or claims, when a third party claims that we

or our Affiliates have infringed the third party’s intellectual property rights by (i) using or permitting the

use of, or being or having been the registered proprietor of a domain name, a brand name,

trademark, logo or other intellectual property, or by (ii) assisting or permitting you to use or to be a

registered proprietor of such rights, which infringe the third party’s rights.

12.5. You must maintain, at your own expense, insurance policies which are required by law and/or would

be expected to be maintained as a matter of good industry practice to a reasonable level. Upon our

request, you must produce evidence of having the required insurance policies.



13. ACCESS TO DATA, AND PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA

Access to data

13.1. In operating the Platform, and providing services to restaurants (including the Services we provide to

you), we and certain of our Affiliates collect and have access to the data that this generates. We and

our Affiliates use this data in a variety of ways and for various reasons, including analytics,

operational purposes, data matching (sometimes performed by a third party service provider), and

using aggregated data in communications to shareholders and in some public materials (e.g. on our

website, or in our annual report). We and certain of our Affiliates also collect and have access to data

relating to Orders and Customer personal data (as set out in the Takeaway.com privacy statement for

Customers).

13.2. You have access to certain data relating to your Restaurant and Orders via the Restaurant Portal.

However, you do not have access to any other data, and we do not share data relating to your

Restaurant, Orders, or any other data, with any other restaurant partner.

Protection of Personal Data

13.3. You and we shall be separate data controllers concerning the personal data that is processed in the

context of this Agreement, each for its own purposes and by its own means and/or on their

respective behalf. This means that you and we are responsible for the processing of the personal

data independently of each other, albeit that the Parties may – in the context of this Agreement -

restrict the purposes and means for which the personal data may be used.



13.4. You acknowledge to be familiar with Takeaway.com’s privacy statement for Customers and will act in

accordance therewith and the Data Protection Legislation. The most recent version of the privacy

statement can be found on the Platform.



13.5. You will not provide personal data of Customers to third parties and will not engage in

communication with Customers other than for purposes of preparation and delivery of the Order.



13.6. You shall promptly (and without undue delay) notify us in writing of any personal data breach of

which you become aware relating to personal data of Customers and keep us up to date in regard to

such data breach.



13.7. Nothing in this Agreement or the arrangements contemplated by it, is intended to construe either

party as i) the processor of the other party; or ii) joint controllers with one another, with respect to

personal data that is shared by one party with the other.



14\. RESTRICTION, SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION

14.1. If:

(a) we (acting reasonably) believe that you are in default of your obligations under this Agreement;

and/or

(b) any of the events in Clauses 14.3(b) apply to you, or in Clause 14.3(c) occur; and/or

(c) we have the specific right to as set out in the rest of this Agreement (which we have under

Clauses 7.6, 8.12, 8.14, 8.15, 8.16, 11.3, 16.2, and Clause 2.9 of Section D (Supplemental



Version 1.1 07-20-2022 12

Terms - Delivery)), and we validly exercise that right,

we may at any time on written notice, restrict, suspend, or terminate part of, the provision of the

Services under this Agreement, including by suspending your profile on the Platform. If you operate

more than one Restaurant, we are entitled to invoke this clause in respect of only one Restaurant or

all of them, in our sole discretion.

14.2. If we restrict, suspend, or terminate part of, the provision of Services to you as set out in Clause 14.1

above, we will provide you with a clear explanation of our reasons for doing so (including the

grounds we're relying on) by email on or before the date on which the restriction, suspension, or

termination, becomes effective. If you wish, you can clarify the facts or circumstances that led to the

restriction, suspension, or termination, using our complaint-handling system. We will then engage

with you to discuss these, and if we determine after that discussion that the restriction, suspension,

or termination, is not appropriate, we will reinstate the applicable Services, including where

applicable your profile on the Platform, without undue delay.

14.3. Without affecting any other right or remedy available, either you or we may at any time on written

notice terminate this Agreement:

(a) if the other is in significant breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement and that breach

is not capable of remedy or, if the breach is capable of remedy, it has not been remedied to the

satisfaction of the non-breaching party within 14 (fourteen) days' of notice of the breach by the

non-breaching party;

(b) if the other becomes insolvent, bankrupt, or enters into any similar or analogous solvency related

procedure;

(c) if a Force Majeure Event makes the provision of the Services impractical or non-commercially

viable; or

(d) you or we are required to by a legal or regulatory obligation.

14.4. You can also terminate this Agreement for convenience, but you must provide us with at least 30

(thirty) days’ written notice before termination takes effect.

14.5. If we terminate this Agreement, we will give you prior notice, and also provide you with a clear

explanation of our reasons for doing so (including the grounds we're relying on), by email at least 30

(thirty) days' before termination takes effect, except where we terminate this Agreement under

Clause 14.3, in which case we will give you as much reasonable prior notice as is possible in the

circumstances, and we will provide the clear explanation of our reasons without undue delay (except

if we are legally restricted from doing that, or we have terminated this Agreement as you have

repeatedly breached you obligations, in which we case we may provide that explanation).

If you wish, you can clarify the facts or circumstances that led to the termination using our

complaint-handling system. We will then engage with you to discuss these, and if we determine after

that discussion that the termination is not appropriate, we will either ensure that termination does not

take place or, if it already has, re-instate this Agreement, without undue delay.

14.6. Promptly after termination of this Agreement for any reason, we will remove your Restaurant profile

from the Platform. You will return any Connection Method in your possession to us in good condition.

14.7. Regardless of anything else in this Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that search engines

which have a licence to use your intellectual property or personal information arising from this

Agreement may continue to hold or use same post termination. Cached versions of the Platform may

continue to exist in the web browser and web servers of search engines and customers following

termination. We will not have any liability to you in connection with these matters to the extent they

lie outside of our control.

14.8. Your and our rights and obligations under Clauses 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.7, 17, 23, 24, 26 and 27, and

any provisions of this Agreement necessary for the interpretation or enforcement of it, will continue

and survive beyond termination of this Agreement.

15.2. We will not be liable to you if we, acting reasonably, decline to provide the Services or decline to act

on your instructions because we are on notice from any person who we have reason to believe is

that franchisor.

15.3. If you sell or transfer the ownership of your business, you must advise the new owner or transferee

of this Agreement and give us notice in writing of the proposed sale or transfer. If you do not give us

transferee we will not be liable to make that payment to the new owner and transferee and you will

be liable to do so.

15.4. If we are notified or informed by a third party, of a change to the ownership of your business or other

important details relating to your business (for example a change of name, or a change to bank

account details) we will make reasonable efforts to contact you. If you don't respond, or if you don't

give us the notice referred to in Clause 15.3, we may change the status of your Restaurant to ‘offline’

or terminate this Agreement. If we make any payments to you that should have been made to the

new owner or transferee we will not be liable to make that payment to the new owner and transferee

and you will be liable to do so.

(a) any of the Consents are revoked, suspended or altered;

(b) you are served with an administrative prohibition notice or order or equivalent; or

Customer are unsafe.

To be clear, other than an alteration to the Consents, the occurrence of any of the events in Clause

16.2(a) to (c) constitutes a breach of this Agreement, and we reserve the right to (amongst other

things) suspend your profile on the Platform in accordance with Clause 14.1

health and safety, tax, data protection, food standards, (including maintaining an appropriate food

under this Agreement resulting from a Force Majeure Event.



20\. WAIVER, VARIATION \& THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS

20.1. Failure to exercise or delay in exercising a right or remedy under this Agreement does not operate as

a waiver (in other words, a voluntary giving-up) or prevent further exercise of that or of any other

right or remedy.

of a right.

binding decision of the court or other government body.
