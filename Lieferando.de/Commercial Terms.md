13.1. In operating the Platform, and providing services to restaurants (including the Services we provide to

you), we and certain of our Affiliates collect and have access to the data that this generates. We and

our Affiliates use this data in a variety of ways and for various reasons, including analytics,

operational purposes, data matching (sometimes performed by a third party service provider), and

using aggregated data in communications to shareholders and in some public materials (e.g. on our

relating to Orders and Customer personal data (as set out in the Takeaway.com privacy statement for

Customers).

13.2. You have access to certain data relating to your Restaurant and Orders via the Partner Hub.

However, you do not have access to any other data, and we do not share data relating to your

Restaurant, Orders, or any other data, with any other restaurant partner.

Protection of Personal Data

13.3. You and we shall be separate data controllers concerning the personal data that is processed in the

context of this Agreement, each for its own purposes and by its own means and/or on their

respective behalf. This means that you and we are responsible for the processing of the personal

data independently of each other, albeit that the Parties may – in the context of this Agreement -

restrict the purposes and means for which the personal data may be used.



13.4. You acknowledge to be familiar with Takeaway.com’s privacy statement for Customers and will act in

accordance therewith and the Data Protection Legislation. The most recent version of the privacy

party as i) the processor of the other party; or ii) joint controllers with one another, with respect to

personal data that is shared by one party with the other.



14\. RESTRICTION, SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION

14.1. If:

(a) we (acting reasonably) believe that you are in default of your obligations under this Agreement;

08-02-2023 13

(c) we have the specific right to as set out in the rest of this Agreement (which we have under

Clauses 7.6, 8.12, 8.14, 8.15, 8.16, 8.17, 8.18, 11.3, 16.2, and Clause 2.9 of Section D

(Supplemental Terms - Delivery)), and we validly exercise that right,

we may at any time on written notice, restrict, suspend, or terminate part of, the provision of the

Services under this Agreement, including by suspending your profile on the Platform. If you operate

more than one Restaurant, we are entitled to invoke this clause in respect of only one Restaurant or

all of them, in our sole discretion.

14.2. If we restrict, suspend, or terminate part of, the provision of Services to you as set out in Clause 14.1

above, we will provide you with a clear explanation of our reasons for doing so (including the

grounds we're relying on) by email on or before the date on which the restriction, suspension, or

termination, becomes effective. If you wish, you can clarify the facts or circumstances that led to the

restriction, suspension, or termination, using our complaint-handling system. We will then engage

with you to discuss these, and if we determine after that discussion that the restriction, suspension,

or termination, is not appropriate, we will reinstate the applicable Services, including where

applicable your profile on the Platform, without undue delay.

14.3. Without affecting any other right or remedy available, either you or we may at any time on written

notice terminate this Agreement:

(a) if the other is in significant breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement and that breach

is not capable of remedy or, if the breach is capable of remedy, it has not been remedied to the

satisfaction of the non-breaching party within 14 (fourteen) days' of notice of the breach by the

non-breaching party;

(b) if the other becomes insolvent, bankrupt, or enters into any similar or analogous solvency related

procedure;

(c) if a Force Majeure Event makes the provision of the Services impractical or non-commercially

viable; or

(d) you or we are required to by a legal or regulatory obligation.

14.4. You can also terminate this Agreement for convenience, but you must provide us with at least 30

(thirty) days’ written notice before termination takes effect.

14.5. If we terminate this Agreement, we will give you prior notice, and also provide you with a clear

explanation of our reasons for doing so (including the grounds we're relying on), by email at least 30

(thirty) days' before termination takes effect, except where we terminate this Agreement under

Clause 14.3, in which case we will give you as much reasonable prior notice as is possible in the

circumstances, and we will provide the clear explanation of our reasons without undue delay (except

if we are legally restricted from doing that, or we have terminated this Agreement as you have

repeatedly breached you obligations, in which we case we may provide that explanation).

If you wish, you can clarify the facts or circumstances that led to the termination using our

complaint-handling system. We will then engage with you to discuss these, and if we determine after

that discussion that the termination is not appropriate, we will either ensure that termination does not

take place or, if it already has, re-instate this Agreement, without undue delay.

14.6. Promptly after termination of this Agreement for any reason, we will remove your Restaurant profile

from the Platform. You will return any Connection Method in your possession to us in good condition.

14.7. Regardless of anything else in this Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that search engines

which have a licence to use your intellectual property or personal information arising from this

Agreement may continue to hold or use same post termination. Cached versions of the Platform may

continue to exist in the web browser and web servers of search engines and customers following

termination. We will not have any liability to you in connection with these matters to the extent they

lie outside of our control.

14.8. Your and our rights and obligations under Clauses 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.7, 17, 23, 24, 26 and 27, and

give us the notice referred to in Clause 15.3, we may change the status of your Restaurant to ‘offline’

under this Agreement resulting from a Force Majeure Event.



20\. WAIVER, VARIATION \& THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS

a waiver (in other words, a voluntary giving-up) or prevent further exercise of that or of any other
