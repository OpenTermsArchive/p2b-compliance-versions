15.15 International Transfer of Personal Data
---------------------------------------------

15.15.1. Your Personal Data may be transferred out of the European Economic Area for storage purposes and be processed by third party companies.

15.15.2. In such case, third party companies will be under a contractual duty to protect your Personal Data by employing appropriate safeguards. To this effect, we employ standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, in line with GDPR requirements.

15.16 Security Measures
-----------------------

We will process your Personal Data at all times in a confidential way and maintain the mandatory duty to secrecy and confidence, in accordance with applicable regulations. For this purpose, we adopt measures of a technical and organizational nature required to guarantee the security and integrity of your Personal Data, depending on the state of the technology, the nature of the stored data and the risks to which they are exposed. Some of the safeguards we employ include firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centres, and information access authorization controls, as well as the limitation of the data we use for you in a way that your identity cannot be revealed by them.

15.17 Your Rights
-----------------

15.17.1. Notwithstanding the purpose or legal basis we rely on to process your data, under certain circumstances, under applicable legislation you have the following rights:

* Request Access: You have the right to request access to your Personal Data.
* Request to Correct Personal Data: You may request that we correct any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
* Request to Erase Personal Data: You may request that we delete or remove any Personal Data where there is no valid legal basis for us continuing to process it. We may not always be able to comply with your request due to legal requirements that will be notified to you at the relevant time.
* Object to Processing of Personal Data: Where there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing because it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information.
* Request Restriction of Processing: This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy or where the use of such data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it or where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
* Request the Transfer of Personal Data: You may request that we provide you, or a third party of your choice, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used to perform a contract with you.
* Withdraw Consent: You may withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Data by emailing our DPO, at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data.
* Right to lodge a Complaint: You have the right to lodge a complaint at any time to a data protection regulator. The relevant supervising authority in Cyprus is the Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection (further information can be found at www.dataprotection.gov.cy).

15.17.2. We do not normally charge any fees for access to your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the above rights). We may charge a reasonable fee if a request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with a request in these circumstances.

15.17.3. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

15.17.4. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one (1) month of receipt. It may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

15.17.5. We do not warrant, undertake and/or represent error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. We will use all reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and shall take immediate rectification actions in the event of a breach of this Privacy Policy. We shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to a breach of this Privacy Policy.
