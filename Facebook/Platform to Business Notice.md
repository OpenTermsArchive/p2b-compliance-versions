We are updating our Platform to Business Notice. You can preview the changes **[here](https://www.facebook.com/legal/p2b_notice_preview)**.

PLATFORM TO BUSINESS NOTICE

This Platform to Business Notice (“**Notice**”) has been created to comply with the Platform to Business Regulation 2019/1150 (“**Regulation**”) that came into force on 12 July 2020.

If you are not a Relevant Business User this Notice does not apply to you.

This Notice provides information about our practices to comply with the fairness and transparency requirements set out in the Regulation.

**Ranking**

We want the products people see on Facebook and Instagram to be as interesting and useful to them as possible.
