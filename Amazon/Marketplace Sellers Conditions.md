THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT GOVERN YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES THROUGH A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS AND IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU OR THE BUSINESS YOU REPRESENT ("YOU") AND AMAZON EU S.A R.L (THE "AGREEMENT"). BY REGISTERING FOR OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU (ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE BUSINESS YOU REPRESENT) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE SERVICE TERMS AND [PROGRAMME POLICIES](https://sellercentral-europe.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G521?locale=en-US) FOR EACH SERVICE YOU REGISTER FOR OR USE IN CONNECTION WITH A PARTICULAR AMAZON SITE.

As used in this Agreement, "we," "us," and "Amazon" means the Amazon company named in the applicable Service Terms and "you" means the applicant (if registering for or using a Service as an individual), or the business the applicant is employed by or represents (if registering for or using a Service as a business). Capitalised terms have the meanings listed in the **[Definitions](https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/on-board/help-content.html?ie=UTF8&agreementID=&hasCloseButton=1&hasPrintButton=1&helpNodeID=&invitationID=&isOnlineMapa=&localizationKey=A1F83G8C2ARO7P&mapaAcceptanceDate=&marketplaceID=A1F83G8C2ARO7P&repeatButtonsAtEnd=1&showTitles=1&tokens=agreement.MERCHANT_ABP#Definitions)** below.  If there is any conflict between these General Terms and the applicable Service Terms and Programme Policies, the General Terms will govern and the applicable Service Terms will prevail over the Programme Policies.

**1\. Enrolment**

To begin the enrolment process, you must complete the registration process for one or more of the Services. By registering for or using the Services you confirm that you did not rely on any oral or written representations made by employees of Amazon and/or any of its affiliates and that you chose the service based on your own due diligence and consideration. Use of the Services is limited to parties that can lawfully enter into and form contracts under applicable law (for example, a particular Amazon Site Country may not allow minors to use the Services).  As part of the application, you must provide us with your (or your business') legal name, Primary Place of Business address, phone number and e-mail address, as well as any other information we may request. Any personal data you provide to us will be handled in accordance with Amazon’s Privacy Notice.  

**2\. Service Fee Payments**

Fee details are described fully in the applicable Service Terms and Programme Policies. You are responsible for all of your expenses in connection with this Agreement, unless this Agreement or the applicable Service Terms provide otherwise. To use a Service, you must provide Amazon Payments Europe s.c.a. (“APE”) or Amazon Payments UK Limited (“APUK”) with valid credit card information from a credit card or credit cards accepted by Amazon ( “Your Credit Card”). You will use only a name you are authorized to use in connection with a Service and will update all of the preceding information as necessary to ensure that it at all times remains accurate and complete. You authorize APE or APUK (and will provide us documentation evidencing your authorization upon our request) to verify your information (including any updated information), to obtain credit reports about you from time to time, to obtain credit authorizations from the issuer of Your Credit Card, and to charge Your Credit Card or debit any of your payment account(s) held with APE and/or APUK, where applicable, for any sums payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise). If you registered for Selling on Amazon before December 14, 2018 and have not yet received an APUK Account Confirmation Notice, all payments to you will be made in accordance with the APE User Agreement. If you registered for Selling on Amazon on or after December 14, 2018 or have received an APUK Account Confirmation Notice, all payments to you in relation to the UK Amazon Site will be made in accordance with the APUK User Agreement and all payments to you in relation to the DE Amazon Site, the ES Amazon Site, the FR Amazon Site, the IT Amazon Site, the NL Amazon Site, the SE Amazon Site and/or the PL Amazon Site will be made in accordance with the APE User Agreement. In addition to charging payable sums to Your Credit Card, you authorize APE or APUK to choose instead to either (a) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you, or (b) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt. Except as provided otherwise, all amounts contemplated in this Agreement will be expressed and displayed in the Local Currency, and all payments contemplated by this Agreement will be made in the Local Currency.

We will promptly notify you of any termination or suspension via email or similar means sent to you individually, and on Seller Central, indicating any options to appeal and the reason, except where we are subject to a legal or regulatory obligation not to provide the specific facts or circumstances or the reference to the applicable ground or grounds for that termination or suspension, or where you have repeatedly infringed this Agreement.

We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any of our obligations under this Agreement by reasons, events or other matters beyond our reasonable control.

**13\. Relationship of Parties**

You and we are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement will be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, sales representative, or employment relationship between the parties. Amazon is not an auctioneer, neither is it an intermediary between the buyer and the seller. You will have no authority to make or accept any offers or representations on our behalf.  You will not make any statement, whether on your site or otherwise, that would contradict anything in this section.  This Agreement will not create an exclusive relationship between you and us. Nothing expressed or mentioned in or implied from this Agreement is intended or will be construed to give to any Person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or in respect to this Agreement. This Agreement and all of the representations, warranties, covenants, conditions, and provisions of this Agreement are intended to be and are for the sole and exclusive benefit of Amazon, you, and relying customers or sellers. As between you and us, you will be solely responsible for all obligations associated with the use of any third party service or feature that you permit us to use on your behalf, including compliance with any applicable terms of use.

**14\. Suggestions and Other Information**

If you or any of your affiliates elect to provide or make available suggestions, comments, ideas, improvements, or other feedback or materials to us in connection with or related to any Amazon Site or Service (including any related Technology), you will, to the extent necessary and authorized by law, irrevocably grant to us, a royalty-free and worldwide license on all right, title, and interest in and to the suggestions for the duration of protection of the underlying rights.  In order to cooperate with governmental requests, to protect our systems and customers, or to ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems, we may access and disclose any information we consider necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to user contact details, IP addresses and traffic information, usage history and posted content.

**15\. Modification**

We will provide at least 15 days’ advance notice in accordance with Section 17 for changes to the Agreement.

However, we may change or modify the Agreement at any time with immediate effect: (a) if we are subject to a legal or regulatory obligation which requires us to change the Agreement in a manner which does not allow us to respect the notice period; or (b) to address any unforeseen and imminent danger related to defending the Services, consumers or you from fraud, malware, spam, data breaches or other cybersecurity risks. We will notify you about any change or modification in accordance with Section 17.  
Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any change to this Agreement in accordance with this Section 15 will constitute your acceptance of that change. If any change is unacceptable to you, you agree not to use the Services and to end the Agreement as described in Section 3.  
  

**16\. Password Security** 

Any password we provide to you may be used only during the Term to access Seller Central (or other tools we provide) to use the Services, electronically accept Your Transactions, and review your completed Transactions.  You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your password.  You may not disclose your password to any third party (other than third parties authorized by you to use your account or Seller Central in accordance with this Agreement) and are solely responsible for any use of or action taken under your password.  If your password is compromised, you must immediately change your password. 

**17\. Miscellaneous**

The laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg govern this Agreement and all of its terms and conditions, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any dispute relating in any way to your use of the Services or this Agreement will be adjudicated in the courts of the district of Luxembourg City, Luxembourg non-exclusively. You may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.  Any attempt to assign or otherwise transfer in violation of this section is void provided, however, that upon notice to Amazon, you may assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any of your Affiliates as long as you remain liable for your obligations that arose prior to the effective date of the assignment or transfer under this Agreement. You agree that we may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under this Agreement: (a) in connection with a merger, consolidation, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or similar transaction;, or (b) to any Affiliate or as part of a corporate reorganization; and effective upon such assignment, the assignee is deemed substituted for Amazon as the party to this Agreement. Subject to that restriction, this Agreement will be binding on, inure to, and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

Amazon may delist your product, or restrict your listing immediately: (i) for legal or regulatory reason; (ii) for illicit or inappropriate content, concern with the safety of the good, counterfeiting, intellectual property infringement or suitability of the good to minors; (iii) to address any unforeseen and imminent danger related to defending the Services or consumers from fraud, malware, spam, data breaches or other cybersecurity risks; or (iv) for the violation of the Agreement including any [Program Policies](https://sellercentral-europe.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G521?language=en_GB&ref=efph_G521_cont_201190440). We will notify you of any such action via email or similar means sent to you individually indicating the reason and any options to appeal.

The authentic language of this Agreement and subsidiary or associated documentation is English and any translations provided are for convenience only. In the event of any conflict or difference in interpretation between the English language version of this Agreement and subsidiary or associated documentation and any translation of them, the English language version and interpretation will prevail. 

Amazon will provide notice to you under this Agreement by posting changes on Seller Central or on the applicable Amazon Services site to which the changes relate (such as the Marketplace Developer site accessible through your account), and by sending you an email notification or by similar means sent to you individually. You must send all notices and other communications relating to Amazon to our Selling Partner Support team via Seller Central, email, the Contact Us form, or similar means. We may also communicate with you in connection with your listings, sales, and the Services electronically and in other media, and you consent to such communications. You may change your e-mail addresses by updating your information in Seller Central.  You will update your e-mail addresses (as well as your legal name, address and phone number) as often as necessary to ensure that they are accurate.  

If any provision of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these terms and conditions and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  This Agreement, together with the APE User Agreement and the APUK User Agreement, represents the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and related subject matter described herein and supersedes any previous or contemporaneous oral or written agreements and understandings.

You expressly agree that Amazon may engage its affiliate(s) or a third party in order to complete one or more of the fulfilment and associated services outlined below.

**F.1. Your Products** 

Once you are accepted into FBA, you must apply to register each product you sell that you wish to include in the FBA programme in connection with a particular Amazon Site.  You may not include any product in the FBA programme which is a FBA Excluded Product for any Amazon Site you wish to register your product with.  We may refuse registration in FBA of any product in connection with any Amazon Site, including on the basis that it is an FBA Excluded Product or that it violates applicable Programme Policies.  You may at any time withdraw registration of any of Your Products from FBA in connection with any Amazon Site.

**F.2. Product and Shipping Information**

You will, in accordance with applicable Programme Policies, provide accurate and complete information about Your Products registered in FBA, and will provide Fulfilment Requests for any Units fulfilled using FBA that are not sold through the Amazon Site ("**Multi-Channel Fulfilment Units**").  You will promptly update any information about Your Products in accordance with our requirements and as necessary so that the information is at all times accurate and complete. 

**F.3. Shipping to Amazon**

**F.3.1.**Except as otherwise provided in Section F-5, for each Amazon Site(s) you register Units in connection with, such Units will be delivered to customers in such Amazon Site Countries only.  You will ship Units to us in accordance with applicable Programme Policies for the particular Amazon Site Your Products are registered in connection with.  You will ensure that: (a) all Units are properly packaged for protection against damage and deterioration during shipment and storage; (b) terms of freight "C.I.P. (Carriage and Insurance Paid) Destination" for domestic Amazon Site Country origin and "D.D.P. (Delivery Duty Paid) Destination" for non-domestic Amazon Site Country origin; and (c) all Units comply with Amazon's labelling and other requirements.  You will be responsible for all costs incurred to ship the Units to the shipping destination (including costs of freight and transit insurance). You will prepay all such shipping costs and Amazon will not pay any shipping.  You are responsible for payment of all customs, duties, taxes and other charges. In the case of any improperly packaged or labelled Unit, we may return the Unit to you at your expense (pursuant to Section F-7) or re-package or re-label the Unit and charge you a corresponding administrative fee.

**F.3.2.** You will not deliver to us, and we may refuse to accept, any shipment of any Unsuitable Unit.

**F-3.3** If you ship Units from outside the EU to fulfilment centres, you will list yourself as the importer/consignee and nominate a customs broker.

We will not be required to physically mark or segregate Units from other inventory units (e.g., products with the same Amazon standard identification number) owned by us, our affiliates or third parties in the applicable fulfilment centre(s). If we elect to commingle Units with such other inventory units, both parties agree that our records will be sufficient to identify which products are Units. We may move Units among facilities. If there is a loss of or damage to any Units while they are being stored, we will  compensate you in accordance with the [FBA Guidelines for the applicable Amazon Site](https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/external/53921/ref=am_53921_cont_200700310?locale=en-US)). If we compensate you for a Unit, we will be entitled to dispose of the Unit pursuant to Section F-7. Our confirmed receipt of delivery does not waive, limit, or reduce any of our rights under this Business Solutions Agreement. We reserve the right to change scheduling restrictions and volume limitations on the delivery and storage of your inventory in the fulfilment centres in accordance with Section 15, and you will comply with any of these restrictions or limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, this article F-4 only covers storage in a fulfilment centre and not shipping to customers.

**F.6.3.** Subject to Section F-7 we will, at your direction, either return or dispose of any Unit that is returned to us by a customer and that we determine is an Unsuitable Unit as provided in Section F-7.  Without limitation of our rights under Section F-7.3, we may elect to return or dispose of that Unsuitable Unit.

**F.6.4.** If Amazon receives a customer return of a Multi-Channel Fulfilment Unit, you will direct us to return or dispose of the Unit at your own cost failing which we may dispose of the Unit as provided in Section F-7.

**F.7.3** We may dispose of any Unsuitable Unit (and you will be deemed to have consented to our action): (a) immediately if we determine that (i) the Unit creates a safety, health or liability risk to Amazon, our personnel or any third party; or (ii) you have engaged in fraudulent or illegal activity; or (iii) we have cause to terminate your use of Services with immediate effect pursuant to Section 3 and are exposed to liability towards a third party; or (b) if you fail to direct us to return or dispose of any Unsuitable Unit within thirty (30) days (or as otherwise specified in the applicable Programme Policy) after we notify you that its removal is required, for instance because your use of FBA is suspended or terminated or your seller account is suspended, terminated or closed. In addition, you will reimburse us for any damages incurred including any expenses we incur in connection with any Unsuitable Units.

**F.7.4.** You may, at any time, request that we dispose of Units.  In this case, we may dispose of these Units as appropriate based on the inventory (for example, by selling, recycling, donating, or destroying it).  Title to each disposed Unit will transfer to us (or a third party we select such as a charity) at no cost, free and clear of any liens, claims, security interests or other encumbrances to the extent required to dispose of the Unit, and we may retain any proceeds we may receive from the disposal.

This article applies to selling in: **France**

Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
======================================

Sellers are responsible for setting their own prices on Amazon stores. In our mission to be Earth's most customer-centric company, we strive to provide our customers with the largest selection, at the lowest price, and fastest delivery as sellers play an important role in achieving this mission.

Sellers agree that Amazon may remove an offer or, in repeated cases, suspend or terminate selling privileges if sellers:

A- Set prices or practices in violation of applicable laws across all EU member states and the UK (such as the books fixed price laws or the shipping regulation for New Books in France); or

B- Set prices which fall below or exceed sellers’ own minimum and maximum price set for that product.

Amazon promptly notifies sellers of any triggering of the Store Fair Pricing Policy affecting their offers or selling privileges, offering sellers the option to resubmit a listing after changing the price or to appeal, as well as referring to the Mediation Policy.
