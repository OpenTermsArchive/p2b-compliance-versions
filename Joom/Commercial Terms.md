Terms of Service for Merchants from the European Union and the United Kingdom
=============================================================================

Please read these terms of service (“Agreement” or “Terms of Service”) carefully before using the website and services offered by SIA Joom (“Joom”). The Agreement sets out the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the website at [https://merchant.joom.com](https://merchant.joom.com/) and Joom’s mobile applications (both iOS and Android) and web-site at [https://www.joom.com/](https://www.joom.com/) (all together referred to as the “Site”). By using the Site, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlinks, including the terms and conditions set out in the Merchant Help Center available at [https://eu-merchant-help.joom.com/hc](https://eu-merchant-help.joom.com/hc). This Agreement applies to all merchants (those, who are selling to users of the Site and hereinafter referred to as the “Merchants”, “Merchant” or “you”). Joom Intellectual Property Policy for Merchants constitutes an integral part of these Terms of Service and is available via [https://merchant.joom.com/ip-policy/](https://merchant.joom.com/ip-policy/).

The contents of this Agreement include the main body as well as all the terms, conditions and policies including (but without limitation) legal statements, privacy policies that have been or will be published or released by Joom at any time. All terms, conditions and policies are an integral part of this Agreement and shall have the same legal effect as the main body of this Agreement.

1\. Joom as a Marketplace and Merchant’s Agent
----------------------------------------------

1.1. Joom provides a platform for Merchants who comply with Joom’s policies and requirements to offer and sell certain items.

Joom acts as a commercial agent of a Merchant within the scope of powers, rights and authorities set in this Agreement, including the powers and rights to negotiate and conclude transactions between Merchants and customers on the Site, set the final price for the items listed on the Site (“Items”), issue invoices for such Items, and (at Joom’s sole discretion) assist Merchants in the receipt and processing of customer’s claims for refund and guarantee on behalf of Merchant.

Joom, as a commercial agent of Merchant, acts in Merchant’s name and at Merchant’s expense. Joom does not act as a commercial agent for a customer.

Customer’s payment obligation to Merchant shall be deemed as performed upon receipt of customer’s payment by Joom (or its payment services provider, as applicable), and Joom via its payment services provider, as applicable, is responsible for remitting the funds to Merchants in the manner described in Joom’s and Merchant’s agreement with payment services provider. If Joom (via payment services provider) does not remit any such amounts to Merchant, Merchant will have recourse only against Joom (its payment services provider, as applicable) and not the customer directly.

Notwithstanding the above mentioned in clause 1.2, Joom has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of Items, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of Merchants to sell Items or the ability of customers to pay for Items.

Joom reserves the right to refuse Merchant’s application in the following cases:

* Absence of registration documents requested by Joom. To be admitted to the Site the Merchant shall be a legal entity or an entrepreneur properly registered in one of the European Union countries or in the United Kingdom as such legal entity or entrepreneur and shall be properly registered for VAT purposes in the country of its principal place of business and/or, where applicable and required, in the country of destination (i.e. the country of customer’s residence).
* Merchant’s product listing contains products either generally prohibited on Joom or prohibited and/or restricted for sale through the Site in the country of destination (i.e. the country from which the product can be ordered by the user) and/or in the Merchant’s country. Please also refer to paragraph 3.
* Merchant has low ratings on other marketplaces (e-commerce platforms) or is not present on them at all.
* There are bad references from trusted sources.

2\. Merchant’s Eligibility and Obligations

When you upload documents such as declarations of conformity, any mandatory or self-declaratory documents and certificates to the products you sell on the Site, you confirm and warrant:

In such a case you also confirm and warrant that you have the right to use and provide Joom with such documents and it will satisfy all requirements of any applicable legislation.

4\. Trade Control Laws
----------------------

4.1. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the EU and/or the UK, the country of origin and the country of destination when selling Items on Joom. You are responsible for determining all applicable trade control, customs and tax laws, obtaining any required government authorizations, and are liable for any penalties resulting from non-compliance.

5\. Economic Sanctions Laws
---------------------------

5.1. Economic sanctions laws in the European Union, the United States and a number of other countries prohibit or restrict unlicensed transactions with various parties (i.e., individuals, entities, government regimes) for example because they are identified as engaging in terrorism, narcotics trafficking, weapons proliferation and/or other activities that threaten those countries’ national security, foreign policies or economies or (and again for example), because they are resident in certain countries or have a connection to those countries (“Denied Parties”). Various government agencies publish lists, or descriptions, of such parties (“Denied Parties Lists”). In addition, many countries maintain trade sanctions and embargo programs against specific countries (“Sanctioned Countries”), such that unauthorized transactions involving these Sanctioned Countries or parties who are resident in those countries or have a connection to those countries are prohibited or restricted.

In order to comply with these and other legal requirements, it is Joom general policy that Items imported from or originating in the following countries and regions may not be sold on Joom:

* Cuba
* Iran
* North Korea
* Syria
* Sudan
* Crimea Region
* Luhansk Region
* Donetsk Region
* Any other country or region as may be notified to Merchants by Joom

No shipments or sales to parties in any of these countries may be conducted through Joom.

Accounts may not be opened or affiliated with a country or region that Joom does not support.

5.2. Additionally, Merchants must not do business with or otherwise engage in or facilitate transactions involving parties, services, and/or goods that are subject to sanctions or other applicable trade control restrictions. This includes, but is not limited to Denied Parties, parties that are owned or controlled by Denied Parties and also parties who are resident in or connected with any country or region if any economic sanctions law that applies to Joom, a Merchant or to any Buyer if and to the extent that such laws prohibit the applicable transaction.

5.3. You must ascertain and comply with any sanctions compliance requirements that apply to your transactions, including any updates to any laws that apply to Joom, a Merchant or to any Buyer and must indemnify Joom against any claim resulting from any breach by you of any sanctions law or and breach by you of this clause 5. Non-compliance with sanctions laws and regulations can result in significant civil and/or criminal monetary penalties, as well as possible imprisonment, seizure of goods, and/or a ban from conducting business.

In case there are any amounts due, and they have not been paid as provided in these Terms and within the period specified, Merchant shall notify Joom via email or other means specified in these Terms or available in the Merchant’s account. If the amounts due have not been paid due to any problems on the Merchant’s side (including, but not limited to incorrect payment details, change of the legal entity on the Merchant’s side that is non-compliant with Joom’s KYC requirements, any Joom’s terms and policies or any applicable legislation), Merchant shall contact Joom and provide Joom with the correct information as soon as possible.

If Joom finds out that there are any unpaid amounts that Merchant does not claim to be paid, Joom will inform the Merchant accordingly and send a notification letter via email or post. Merchant shall respond to such letter and either confirm the amount payable and provide Joom with any information that may be requested to execute the payment or provide Joom with evidence that the amount is not correct within 10 business days after the date when the letter is sent. If Merchant does not reply to the letter and does not contact Joom on this matter within 6 (six) months from the date of the letter or the Merchant is liquidated and none of its legal successors contact Joom, Joom reserves the right to write-off the unpaid amounts without any notification to Merchant.

In other cases, returns shall be made at the expense of the customer. All Items may be returned except for those Items which cannot be returned under the applicable laws and regulations of the country of destination.

6.13. In the event Joom introduces a new service, the fees for that service (added to a commission defined in 6.1.) are effective from its launch date.

7\. Listing and Selling
-----------------------

7.1. By listing an item on the Site, you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with Joom’s published policies (regarding IP rights protection, guarantees, personal data protection, advertising, etc.). You also warrant that you are legally authorized to sell the item. You must accurately describe your item and all terms of sale on your Joom account page. Your listings may only include reliable text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other contents relevant to the sale of that item. All Items must be listed with appropriate and truthful tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe Item(s) for sale in that listing. If the “in stock” quantity is more than one, all Items in that listing must be identical.

7.2. All sales made via the Site are binding for Merchants. The merchant is obligated to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the customer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: the transaction cannot be completed due to laws, regulations, policies, natural disasters, wars, strikes and other unforeseen factors. The cost and losses arising from not completing orders in time shall be undertaken by Merchant.

7.3. Merchant hereby agrees that by listing items on the Site it warrants that:

7.3.1. It has ownership of each such listed item at the moment of the conclusion of the contract for the sale of the item with a customer.

7.3.2. Any item that is stored in a warehouse or a fulfillment center and/or by any other third party involved by the Merchant (regardless to the purpose of any such warehouse facility and/or third-party involvement – whether it is importation, storage and delivery, and regardless of where such warehouse, fulfilment center and/or third party is located) is in the Merchant’s ownership at the moment of conclusion of the contract for the sale of such item with a customer, and the Merchant is a lawful owner of such item at the moment of conclusion of the contract with a customer.

7.3.3. Any item that is stored in a warehouse or a fulfillment center and/or by any other third party involved by the Merchant is transferred to such place and/or such third party in full compliance with any applicable laws and regulations of the country of origin, the country of destination and transit countries. Such applicable laws and regulations include inter alia customs and tax laws and regulations. All applicable customs duties, taxes and other mandatory payments related to such items and their transfer to a warehouse or a fulfillment center and/or to any other third party are paid fully and promptly, items are declared properly and all other requirements to their sale and transitions are fully observed. Merchant hereby agrees to indemnify Joom and to hold Joom as well as Joom’s parent company, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, and employees completely harmless from any claims made by any third parties, including government authorities, against Joom and/or Joom’s related parties mentioned in this clause relating to, or arising from, any breach of the above warranties or obligations arising therefrom.

8\. Ranking. Promotional Activities
-----------------------------------

8.1. Ranking of products as the results of the user’s search query depends on several factors and their various combinations, aimed at optimizing the search query results for a particular user.

The ranking of products is determined by an automated ranking algorithm. The main parameters used by the ranking algorithm are those that indicate the product’s relevance for a particular user and are based on the overall product’s popularity among the Site’s users. Such parameters vary depending on a particular user’s history, search query wording, the relevance of products to such wording, etc. There is no exhaustive list of parameters as their number and degree of impact are different with regard to different users. In other words, the more product, its description, tags, rating, price, availability to a particular region (country of destination), etc. correspond to a user, its history, preferences, search wording, etc., the more chances for such product to be on the top of the search query results. Product’s popularity is determined based on the set of criteria, including, but not limited to the number of orders, number of reviews and the product’s rating according to such reviews, product’s price, popularity and reliability of the product’s brand. The algorithm used for determining products popularity is dynamically updated and may change the prioritization of one criterion over others influencing product ranking on the Site.

Ranking of products is based not only on the popularity of the product as compared to all other products on the Site but also on their popularity within particular products categories. Popularity includes, for example, the number of views of a particular product, number of orders and number of reviews. For example, if there are no products with orders history in a product category or none of them has a review, the algorithm will use other criteria to determine prioritization between the products within such category (such as brand, product’s price, etc.). Popularity includes, for example, number of views of a particular product, number of orders and number of reviews.

To understand better what parameters can affect your products’ ranking, please find below examples of parameters used by the ranking algorithm to determine which products correspond to a search result most:

* Wording of the query: products containing the words corresponding to the search query will be prioritized and will appear among the search query results more frequently.
* Product’s category: products from the category with the name corresponding to the query wording most will be prioritized among the search results.
* Product’s name, description and tags: products with names, words in descriptions and tags assigned by merchants corresponding to the query wording most will be prioritized.
* Merchant’s store name and the brand name: the degree of matching the search query wording with the names of the store and the brand, and the popularity of the store and the brand affect the search query results.
* Quality (such as relevance and clarity) of the information on the product provided by the Merchant and its level of detail.

The accurate and complete product description, the clear and full name of the product, product’s photos of high quality among other factors may lead to the increase in the product’s card views by the users and, therefore, may affect the frequency of the product’s appearance among the search query results. In particular, all the above-mentioned factors may affect the frequency of the product’s card access by the users, while the frequency of such access and the number of times users add a particular product to saved items or a product card in their turn increase the frequency of appearance of such item in the relevant searching results.

Products promoted via Joom Ads (as defined below) may constitute approximately up to 30 per cent of search results. The certain proportions vary depending on the search query and the number of products on the Site corresponding to the query.

8.2. There is a section on the main page on the website version of the Site as well as in the app version, which contains the set of products that are shown to a user prior to or without any search query. Products are chosen to such section on the Site by the automated algorithm as well.

The first and main set of rules used by the algorithm to choose products to be shown to a user in such section can be described by three main groups of products that will be chosen by the algorithm:

* Products to be chosen to the section shall have reviews from the users. This part will also include the products from stores that have Top Store status (please refer to the relevant section of the Merchant Help Center to familiarize yourself with the Top Store functionality and criteria). The proportion between products with reviews and products from Top Stores will depend on a user’s region (for example, not every merchant having Top Store status can deliver products to a particular user’s country), user's history on the Site, etc.
* Products promoted via Joom Ads will consist approximately up to 30 per cent of all number of products visible in the section.
* Randomly chosen products will also be included in the section. The randomness of such selection means that the algorithm will freely choose the products to be shown among all the products that are available to a particular user, even if such products do not have views, reviews, etc.

As soon as the set of products is composed using the above criteria, the following criteria are used by the algorithm to adapt the section to a particular user:

* Whether a particular product can be delivered to the user’s country.
* Merchant’s performance in a user’s country (rate of cancellations of orders, rate (number) of returns, etc).
* User’s preferences (i.e. previous interactions of a user with products, products categories, etc.).

Please note that the algorithm is created and set in such a manner that will be intended on showing products that are the most relevant to a particular user.

8.3. There are certain promotional instruments available to the Merchant, the information on which can be found in the Merchant Help Center, such as special promotions, daily promotions, and Joom Ads (Joom Ads Terms of Service with detailed information about the tool available at https://merchant.joom.com/ads-terms/). The Merchant’s products participating in the promotions will appear in the search query results among other products satisfying the above-mentioned criteria (i.e. they match the search query wording, etc.), and in addition, they will be automatically prioritized over the products not participating in the promotions. Besides, the Merchant’s products participating in the promotions will be shown in the relevant search query results being supplemented by the standard discount badge or the “SALE” discount badge.

Please refer to the relevant sections of the Merchant Help Center to be sure that you are aware of the most up-to-date information on promotional instruments and the way the Merchant can use them.

8.4. When you place the product offers on the Site You agree that your products can be advertised via external marketing tools of third-party advertisers, including, but not limited to social network and search engines platforms.

Products advertised via external marketing channels are chosen by the algorithms using a set of different criteria such as product’s reviews, the number of orders of this product, the product’s price as compared to other identical or similar products, etc. In general, the more popular a particular product the higher chances for it to be chosen by the algorithm to the external advertising. For the targeted advertising, the history of a particular user’s interaction with products on the Site predetermines the products to be advertised to such users via advertising channels.

The algorithms automatically update the prioritization of products between themselves using the above-mentioned criteria that are dynamically and automatically updated. The more popular the particular product becomes, the higher chances that it will be chosen by the algorithm for external advertising. Please note that external advertisers have their own set of rules that may affect the visibility and frequency of appearance of a particular product or product category on the advertiser’s platform. Joom cannot influence the advertiser’s platform rules and advertising mechanisms, as the result, neither the number of Merchant’s products that will be accepted for promotion and visibility of Merchant’s products in the external marketing channels.

Joom reserves the right to use certain products and/or categories of products for external advertising tests purposes. Such tests are limited in time and/or market of destination and help Joom to estimate the efficiency of advertising tools regarding such product categories or items and improve internal algorithms.

Upon expiration of the above-mentioned term your log in or further use of the “Service” shall be considered as your confirmation of acknowledgement with and acceptance of the revised, updated Agreement. The 15-day notice period can be extended by Joom if any such update or change require Merchants to make technical or commercial adaptations in order to comply with the change. Any such extended term will be communicated by Joom to the Merchants in the notification.

If the Merchant continues to use the service during the 15-day notice period (for example, submits new goods or otherwise explicitly expresses its intention to continue to use the Service), such Merchant’s actions shall be considered as clear affirmative actions to waive the notice period, except in cases where the reasonable and proportionate notice period is longer than 15 days because the changes to these terms, any other terms, conditions and policies of the service require the Merchant to make significant technical adjustments. In such exceptional cases, the notice period will not be considered as automatically waived.

If the Merchant does not agree to any alteration or amendment of the terms, conditions and policies, the Merchant shall terminate this Agreement by submitting a written notice to Joom within 15 days from receipt of the notification from Joom. The moment of sending the notification by Joom is considered to be the moment of the notification receipt.

23.2. The above-mentioned 15-days period does not apply in the following cases:

* It is waived in an unambiguous manner by the Merchant concerned.
* The need to implement the change without respecting the notice period stems from a legal or regulatory obligation incumbent on Joom under any applicable law.
* Changes are of minor nature (i. e. editorial ones which do not change the content or meaning of these Terms).

23.3. The Merchant has the right to terminate the Agreement at any time with at least 30 days prior written notification of Joom. The access to the Merchant’s account will be blocked upon expiration of the mentioned period.

23.4. Joom reserves the right to terminate the Joom service for any reason, at any time (including but not limited to the cases when Merchant’s and PSP’s agreement is terminated or Merchant’s account with PSP is closed) with at least 30-day prior notification sent to the Merchant.

23.5. Unless separately stated, any new content that will expand the scope of this Agreement shall be subject to this Agreement and shall be considered as a part thereof.
